By subdividing a data set into meaningful groups of islands, we can perform analytics against it that would otherwise be slow, error-prone, or seemingly impossible!

Data clustering can be applied to complex data sets in order to answer questions about winning streaks, financial performance, monitoring/alerting, goal achievement, and more!

Data quality becomes critical when crunching data in this fashion.  We address duplicate data, bad data, NULL, and any other unexpected weirdness that a user might throw at us.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data.  A complete set of historical baseball records will be used as our imperfect sample data in order to everything from a player's hitting streak to the longest winning streak by a team on Wednesdays at night.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 2:45:00 PM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 3:45:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>108080</importID><speakers><speaker><id>108080</id><name>Dejan Sarka</name></speaker></speakers><track>Artificial Intelligence  Machine Learning</track><location><name>Cloud, AI  ML 1</name></location><title>Business Analysis with T-SQL</title><description>You can make advanced business analytics also with T-SQL, you do not need to use R, Python, or some other currently fashionable language for every single in-depth view in your data.

You will learn how to use T-SQL for queries that you might already be familiar with, for aggregating queries. But this is only to warm you up. Then you will learn how to do hazard and survival analysis, market basket analysis with association rules using different measures like support and confidence, and even sequential market basket analysis, when there is a sequence in the basket. Then the session introduces the look-alike model, which is a mixture of k-nearest neighbor and decision trees algorithms.

Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Plan Correction capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of the Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 1:30:00 PM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 2:30:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>108349</importID><speakers><speaker><id>108349</id><name>Björn Peters</name></speaker></speakers><track>Cloud Technology</track><location><name>Cloud, AI  ML 1</name></location><title>Change your skills - from an onpremise DBA to a cloud DBA</title><description>In this session, everything will be around changing your daily business from an on-premise environment to a cloud world... new challenges, new tasks, and new options... in order not to struggle too often, you need to create new knowledge and learn a lot of new stuff, so I want to show several ways to update your skills and what you really need to become cloud database admin.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 1:30:00 PM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 2:30:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>107929</importID><speakers><speaker><id>107929</id><name>Bob Duffy</name></speaker></speakers><track>Power BI</track><location><name>Power BI  Power Platform 1</name></location><title>Financial Modelling with Power BI</title><description>Bob has been involved in taking Financial Models from paper based to highly dynamic analytics models in Microsoft BI for many large enterprises in Ireland.

How many Dashboards are there in a workspace?
Which Datasource is this Dataset configured to use?
Who is allowed to see this Report?
Can I take ownership of this Dataset?
How do I resfresh my Dataset?
Is my Dataset refreshing on a schedule?
...
Those are just some of the questions we will find the answers to.

Examples will be provided in Powershell, which may require minute skills up front. Not to worry, a quick intro will be provided as well.

The traditional way of doing things on-prem has unfortunately added to this divide - either you're a networking specialist or a DBA, and very rarely will the same person do both jobs. 
As an on-prem DBA, chances are that you never had to think twice about which network the database was in, what kind of endpoint was used for the traffic or how the firewall was configured. In Azure, things can get rather complex pretty quickly - especially when working with the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) version of Azure SQL Server. 
This session will walk you through the basics of networking, explore the concept of virtual networks and firewalls, and explain the use of endpoints - all from the perspective of how they relate to Azure SQL Server. We will be looking at both how the technical components work, and also why one would choose a specific design in favor of another.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 9:00:00 AM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 10:00:00 AM</endTime></event><event><importID>107910</importID><speakers><speaker><id>107910</id><name>Gonzalo Bissio</name></speaker></speakers><track>Cloud Technology</track><location><name>Cloud, AI  ML 2</name></location><title>Azure Sql DB Managed instance, a different sql server?</title><description>On this session we are going to cover Azure sql db managed instance service.

Technical success will not happen with our organizational success - they work hand in hand to lead to a successful conclusion.

As we walk through this session we will discuss and demo the technologies and tools that are useful for a cloud migration - and we\'ll review some that are not useful and talk about why they should be avoided.

Let's explore the current set of features, childhood diseases left behind and potential for improvement.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 11:30:00 AM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 12:30:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>108298</importID><speakers><speaker><id>108298</id><name>Julie Koesmarno</name></speaker></speakers><track>Administration</track><location><name>Application  Database Development</name></location><title>Notebooks 101 for SQL People</title><description>Are you a database developer, a DBA or a data analyst? Do you find spending quite a bit of time trying to reproduce analysis or reproduce issues and the troubleshooting techniques? This Notebooks 101 session is for you!

The lack of rigor in being able to reproduce analysis in business context or to reproduce data troubleshooting can lead to confusion and time wasted on work that had been previously done. With Notebooks, Data Professionals can share their techniques and data sources used for the data analysis or troubleshooting for code review and reproducible insights/troubleshooting. 

Azure Data Studio Notebooks support SQL and KQL natively with intellisense; with easy to use charting capabilities. With Notebooks and Jupyter Book (collection of Notebooks) in Azure Data Studio, it’s also easy now for your team to build an onboarding guide (user manual) / documentation on data sources, useful sample scripts and tutorials.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 4:00:00 PM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 5:00:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>110569</importID><speakers><speaker><id>110569</id><name>Martin Wild</name></speaker></speakers><track>Administration</track><location><name>Administration</name></location><title>How to continuously optimise your hybrid SQL Server estate</title><description>So you want to be able to optimise your hybrid production databases but concerned about licensing, performance and compute costs?
In this session attendees will learn how to record workloads from production instances and replay them either on-prem or on to Azure instances (VMs and managed instances) and compare workload profiles (ie. wait times, time of day), identify bottlenecks and explore SQL tuning techniques.
We can show you how to justify modifying VM resources and compare the impact on performance to get the right balance of performance and cost, and also tuning queries to reduce IO or CPU.
 We will also demonstrate how to replay production workloads in a test/development environment. Ensuring a high accuracy of regression testing in CI/CD.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 10:15:00 AM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 11:15:00 AM</endTime></event><event><importID>108188</importID><speakers><speaker><id>108188</id><name>Benni De Jagere</name></speaker></speakers><track>Power BI</track><location><name>Power BI  Power Platform 1</name></location><title>Designing impactful visualisations for your data</title><description>As Data is key, visualising said data is even more important. We want our message to be understood with ease, and merely with a couple of glances. Hence making sure the receiving party can do so with ease will be vital to our success.

During this session, we'll go through some steps on how to maximise the potential of data visualisations. Starting at choosing the right types of visualisations, and which colour palettes are good matches for your message, we'll also make sure that our designs are as inclusive as we can possibly make them. Wrapping up with a few common use cases, you’ll definitely pick up a few new things to take home with you.

Walking out of this session, you can expect to have a decent understanding on a few common design principles for your data visualisations and reports.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 10:15:00 AM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 11:15:00 AM</endTime></event><event><importID>108426</importID><speakers><speaker><id>108426</id><name>Ferenc Csonka</name></speaker></speakers><track>Power BI</track><location><name>Power BI  Power Platform 1</name></location><title>Power BI Dataflows on Steroids: Handling 100+ million records using Enhanced Compute Engine</title><description>Power BI dataflows used for self-service data preparation within the Power BI ecosystem. When a large volume of data and complex transformations should be handled, Enhanced Compute Engine should be enabled to support DirectQuery queries against Power BI dataflows and accelerate the transformations in upstream dataflows. In this session, we will present how to use Enhanced Compute Engine for managing 100+ million records in multi-phase ETL processes containing complex transformations, then implementing Power BI composite models and aggregations over this large amount of data stored in Power BI dataflows. We will also present in detail the best practices for Power BI dataflows to manage such a huge volume of data. We will focus also on how to store dataflows in your organization’s ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2 account instead of using the built-in one.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 2:45:00 PM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 3:45:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>107978</importID><speakers><speaker><id>107978</id><name>Scott Klein</name></speaker></speakers><track>Administration</track><location><name>Administration</name></location><title>The ins and outs of securing SQL Server traffic</title><description>We are frequently hearing of an enterprise-size business being hacked, data being stolen, or data being exploited. Data security has always been important, but it should not be taken for granted. Data is information, and one of the greatest assets to a business, and when it is compromised, things go south quickly.

While there are multiple levels of security (securing data at rest, data in traffic, etc.), this session will focus on securing data that is on the move; ie., securing traffic between a client and server. We'll discuss and look at two solutions: Certificates and IPsec, exploring them in detail, outlining the pros and cons of each, how to set up and configure them, and when to use what.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 4:00:00 PM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 5:00:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>108063</importID><speakers><speaker><id>108063</id><name>Hugo Kornelis</name></speaker></speakers><track>Application  Database Development</track><location><name>Application  Database Development</name></location><title>From adaptive to intelligent: query processing in SQL 2019</title><description>As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the “adaptive query processing” features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as “intelligent query processing”. This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help – or hurt! – you.</description><startTime>1/15/2021 11:30:00 AM</startTime><endTime>1/15/2021 12:30:00 PM</endTime></event><event><importID>108329</importID><speakers><speaker><id>108329</id><name>Ben Weissman</name></speaker></speakers><track>Cloud Technology</track><location><name>Cloud, AI  ML 1</name></location><title>Azure SQL anywhere.
