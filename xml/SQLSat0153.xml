      <title>SMO Internals for High Performance PowerShell</title>
      <description>Ever wanted to know what happens in SQL Server when you use PowerShell and SMO to manage a SQL Server?  How fast can your automation really go? I will take you through the most common objects in SMO and the internals of what happens when you use those objects. We will examine the TSQL that is generated, and learn techniques that lead to high efficiency.  We will dive deep through the collections that make SMO the powerful tool it is. Combining the flexibility of PowerShell and SMO Internals is a recipe for awesome sauce.  Come peek behing the curtain and squeeze the speed out of your automation scripts using PowerShell and SMO.  You'll be glad you did.</description>

      <title>The Accidental Programmer</title>
      <description> 	Most people in the database world have heard of the term, "The Accidental DBA", those programmers who have to work with databases. How about the other side of the coin? What about DBA's an Dev's who have to write code or have to work closely with programmers? This presentation is a best practices guide for working with SQL Server in a .Net environment. You will learn how to recognize when bad code is written that interacts with the database, how to track it down, and most importantly how to fix it. On top of that you will also receive an introduction to object oriented programming concepts such as data abstraction, encapsulation, tier architecture, and class objects so that you can better communicate with your programmers.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Dimensional Data Modeling</title>
      <description>Data modeling is all about representing the real world in the database, and for 30 years the ER Model has been the preferred method for designing databases where the goal is to "get the data in" by capturing business transactions. But the ER Model is not the most efficient model where the goal is to "get the data back out". The Dimensional Model allows us to take a very different look at all that data and restructure it in a way that is optimized for aggregation and summarizing so that we can unlock its information potential and build effective "Business Intelligence" systems. This presentation takes you "through the looking glass" to introduce you to a world of "fact tables", "dimensions", "star schemas" and more.</description>

      <title>SQL Azure Scalability with Federations</title>
      <description>With more and more companies moving to a cloud solution, the necessity to easily and efficiently scale their database solution is critical. This session will discuss how to scale SQL Azure using SQL Azure Federations, a recent addition to SQL Azure that provides the ability to build scalable, elastic, and multi-tenant solutions in SQL Azure. SQL Azzure Federations bring the sharding pattern into SQL Azure as a first class citizen as a way to achieve greater scalability and performance from the database tier of your application through horizontal partitioning at the database level. This session will look at Federations from a real-world point of view, by applying Federations to a real-life database. We will also look at performance benefits.</description>

      <title>Table Compression</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</description>

      <description>SSIS 2012 added rounded corners and Undo/Redo to the designer, but what else was added to make this worth the upgrade? In this session there will be as many demos of the new features as can be fit into the time provided. Along with the rounded corners, you will also see the changes to deployment, SSIS catalog database, metadata/XML updates, Parameters, logging updates, Data Taps, ODBC support, script debugging, PowerShell interface and as many others as we can get through. If you haven't seen what has been updated in SSIS 2012, this will be the session to cover the most!</description>

      <title>Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels</title>
      <description>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

      <title>Service Broker in Action</title>
      <description>SQL Server Service Broker is a messaging framework built into the SQL Server engine. It enables SQL Server to handle messaging between servers and applications with light setup and overhead. The flexibility of the framework enables Service Broker to queue event notifications, task execution requests or other messages while leveraging the strength of SQL Server transaction management, reliability and recoverability. In this session we will see how to set up Service Broker, discuss case studies where it has been implemented in industry, and step through a practical example implementing an audit log.</description>

      <title>Release Management: A Necessary Evil</title>
      <description>The very nature of a database system is to be dynamic; rarely static. The applications that use databases tend to change, requiring changes to occur within our databases.  The totality of pieces and parts that comprise this ‘change’ will be combined into a ‘Release’ that will be applied to your systems. Controlling this change is not rocket science, but it is not without its complexities. We will discuss various terms, processes, ideas, and suggest tools to assist you in performing this necessary function, while minimizing risk, and impacting your systems in a graceful fashion.</description>

      <description>NoSQL is one of the hot "new" things in the developer world. As DBAs inevitably someone will come to us for help or advice on (or possibly choosing) a NoSQL solution. This session aims to give you a basic understanding in order to best answer those questions for your organization.

In this presentation I will cover: What exactly NoSQL is (and is not), ACID compliance of some popular NoSQL solutions, main differences between traditional RDBMS and NoSQL, why NoSQL popular with developers, and when you might (or might not) want to leverage it for a solution.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
