      <description>Autonomous means capable of existing independently. Think maintenance free, self-healing, auto-tuning databases able to detect and automatically mitigate security risks. Sounds like impossible dream, but here is the best part - Azure is gradually making that next level of automation possible. Cloud economy of scale combined with unique features of Azure PaaS resources transform and enhance the way we collect, store and process data. And that also affects our professional lives. Find out where we are on The Road to The Autonomous Databases, what are main building blocks, what kind of obstacles we still have to overcome and how to turn these challenges into opportunities.</description>

      <description>Even though the Cloud is becoming more popular every day, most companies still want to host their Data Platform on-premises. However, the Cloud also offers huge potential in this area and technologies and tools - some of them only exist in the Cloud at all! This session focuses purely on Microsoft Azure and the services it provides to build a scalable, powerful and yet low-cost Analytics Platform in the Cloud. Based on a real-world scenario I will show how these components play together and how on-premises data and can be integrated into this pure Cloud system.</description>

What type of encryption should you use in your environment? On the session I will walk through available options in Microsoft SQL Server and show when to use encryption, how to identify threats, and countermeasure them by using options like Transparent Data Encryption, SSL certificates, Always Encrypted, etc. After this session, you will know a set of best practices that you can apply in your environment.</description>

      <title>Bulk Load and Minimal Logging</title>
      <description>Session subject is bulk load and minimal logging. I will show you on various demos how bulk load and minimal logging behieves on heap and cluster tables, in-memory tables, clustered and non-clustered columnstore tables and on all combinations as well.</description>

      <title>Score a (row) goal and beat a query optimizer</title>
      <description>Query optimizer is a magical piece of architecture inside SQL Server which instructs the engine how your query is going to be executed. It performs a great job …unless it doesn’t. 

In this session we will have a deep look on cases where the query optimizer fails and explain why is it happening. Expect to see a real code written by real developers which will be tuned just in front of you to perform several times faster. If you want to (or possibly need to) take control of execution plan, this session is right for you!</description>
