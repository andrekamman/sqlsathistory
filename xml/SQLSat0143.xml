      <description>Advancing Data Storage:
How Flash-Optimized Storage Architectures 
Accelerate Performance and Simplify Storage Management
This presentation will explore the evolution of storage architectures over the past 25 years, reviewing the technology inflection points and core business drivers that have propelled the transitions from direct attached to monolithic to modular storage solutions.  
We are at the beginning of the next major technology inflection driving enterprise storage. Solid state drives (SSDs) promise to solve the performance challenges inherent in spinning disks, rendering traditional storage architectures obsolete.    
But SSDs by themselves are not the solution. The next decade will be dominated by storage architectures desig</description>
