      <description>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

      <description>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

      <title>XML Features in SQL 2005</title>
      <description>XML in SQL 2000 wasn't very exciting and it was easy to dismiss it altogether by just relying on developers to handle any XML needed within the application. SQL 2005 changes the game and this session will show you how to use the new XML data type, do basic XML operations on XML data, and showcase the changes to FOR XML that make it so much more useful. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML if you do need to use it!

      <title>The Truth About Disk Performance and Configuration</title>
      <description>Would you buy a million dollar race car then show up to the track on a clear day with rain tires that aren’t properly inflated and wonder why you’re only doing 180 when the manufacturer says it can do 220? Your answer was probably close to something like "Of course not!". Now let’s suppose that your million dollar race car is really your DB server and your tires are your hard drives. Do you know the right configuration to use to get the best performance out of them? Sure, there's RAID 1, RAID 10, and RAID 5 but do you know which combination of partition offset, RAID stripe size, and allocation unit size to use? This session will answer those questions by looking at the results of extensive testing performed against local disks and DASD encl</description>

      <title>Identifying and Removing Duplicate Records</title>
      <description>Perhaps you inherited a database with one or more tables having duplicate potential keys or maybe even entire duplicate records or maybe you generated a recordset from a SELECT statement that has duplicate records. In any case, you have a problem. You need to identify which tables have duplicate records or duplicate index values, isolate those records, and then delete only the duplicate records from the table. This session will focus on the functions and methods that you can use to identify and remove duplicate data from your tables</description>

      <title>Save Time and Merge It</title>
      <description>The SQL Server 2008 MERGE command combines the features of the Insert and Update commands into a single powerful statement.  You can now insert new data into one table while also update or delete data from an existing table with a single statement.  In this session, we will take a look at this new addition to your TSQL toolbox in SQL Server 2008 to show how to merge two tables without creating duplicate records, how to synchronize two tables, how to use the OUTPUT clause with MERGE to save deleted records from the merge into an archival table, how indexing effects performance of MERGE statements and more.</description>

      <title>IIS, ASP\ASP.NET,  SQL Security HowTo</title>
      <description>By now we all know that we should use Windows Authentication to connect to SQL Server from our IIS applications...but most of us don't know how. This session aims to clear up the confusion by demonstrating the ways that ASP  ASP.NET applications can be configured to make secure connections from different versions of IIS so that we can keep our connections secure and our DBAs happy.

      <title>SSIS - SQL server information</title>
      <description>As a DBA in a new environment you need to learn as much as you can about the SQL Servers in your enterprise.  I came across an SSIS package, created by Rodney Landrum, which gave me the core of what I was looking for.  This session will focus on the benefits of the SSIS package as well as provide a walkthrough of the SSIS package, which I have made several changes to support our infrastructure.  The server information included is OS edition, OS service pack level, CPU, RAM, Free drive space, SQL server version, SQL service pack, etc.  Session will also demonstrate how to deploy this package to an SSIS server and schedule it via SQL agent.</description>

      <title>SSIS - A Beginning Framework</title>
      <description>Most developers would agree that every SSIS solution will have the same fundamental outline.  A basic framework will expedite the process by handling the common tasks between the systems while allowing the developer to concentrate on the task at hand.  This framework will consist of many items, including but not limited to setting up package configurations, logging, audit trails, error handling, naming standards, etc.  

This session will present an example framework which can be used as the basis for future SSIS Package development.</description>

      <title>RESTful Data</title>
      <description>REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With ADO.NET Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

This session will describe RESTful Data, the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.

      <title>The DBA Script Thumb</title>
      <description>This session will present a top 10 (maybe 20) list of queries and tools that DBAs can use daily. The idea is that everything is included on a single 1G or less thumb drive to be portable. From simple T-SQL statements to full blown SSIS packages, the session demonstrates how to interogate, diagnose, report on, and resolve issues that are most prevalent for DBAs: disk space, security, backup locations, database and server documentation, performance and much more. All queries, which are SQL 2000, 2005 and yes even 2008 tried and true will be made available in the session to copy to your own thumb drive. If you are lucky you might even receive a free coveted thumb to store the queries.</description>
