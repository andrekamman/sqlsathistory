      <title>My Power BI report is slow: what should I do?</title>
      <description>You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?
This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.
At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.</description>

      <description>Women make up less than 20% of the tech world and they're leaving the field at a rate over 3 times the rate that men are.  Women cite lack of effective mentorship as one of the leading reasons for their exodus.  Whether you're a colleague, a manager or someone who wants to change the status quo, your opportunity to effectively tip the scales changes.  

What do you do for a living, what level are you at in your career and are you in any kind of management role?  Can utilizing women's groups either at work or via a professional organization work for you? In this session, we'll discuss different ways you can mentor and sponsor women in tech.  We'll provide concrete steps you can take to mentor, sponsor or just offer support. These solutions vary based on who YOU are, where you are in your career, if you have hiring/promotion influence, etc.  Learn how you can make a difference.</description>

      <title>Power BI Deployment Strategies:  The Business versus I.T.</title>
      <description>Microsoft’s Power BI service has allowed end users and business analysts to exercise their creativity as developers.  The expansion of department resources to create elegant and visually appealing reports for themselves and their organization at a fast pace, has taken some of the burden off developers, or has it?  
Are you hoarding your environment with unorganized piles of data to feed your wonderful Power BI reports?  In this life of point and click, drag and drop reporting, we sometimes lose sight of cohesive business standards, data integration and data modeling.
In this session, we will look at potential data management concerns that include but are not limited to; overlapping data, inconsistent naming conventions, undocumented transformations, mismatch data types and varying granularity.  We will focus on the importance of having a solid data model and managing data governance using Power BI as well as traditional tools and best practices.</description>

      <title>Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI</title>
      <description>No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.</description>

With its powerful capabilities, Power BI can serve as a versatile tool to prepare, analyze and visualize data in Healthcare organizations already using Microsoft Technologies for data management and work flows. 

This session will provide an overview of how Microsoft Excel users and Power BI beginners in healthcare organizations can transition to Power BI for an agile data analysis and visualization. We will discuss use cases and illustrate rapid data processing and visualization using a sample healthcare dataset (Electronic Health Record or Claims Data).

Takeaways: 
•	Understand the path from Microsoft Excel to Power BI
•	Connect and prepare data
•	Model and analyze data
•	Create and publish reports and dashboard</description>

      <title>A Whistle stop Tour of Microsoft SQL Server and Azure BI Offerings</title>
      <description>Get ready for a wild ride as we identify  discuss the combination of Microsoft technologies which make up the “Data territory”, the offerings for BI/DW/Data Science practitioners. Some parts of the territory are ripe w/opportunity while other less-discovered parts are a bit hostile.

We’ll leave the engine running at each stop but spend enough time for the passengers to understand exactly what the various components mean. Throughout the tour, we’ll talk to the applicability of the components based on sizes of data (and customer). 

At journey’s end, the attendee will want to take action and their own path into Microsoft “Data Territory”.

Learnings:	
Attendees will have a more complete view of Microsoft’s SQL Server and Azure BI “Data Platform” offerings
Attendees can expect to be whisked into aspects of the Microsoft Offerings they may have never heard of or understood.
Attendees should be able to correlate the various Microsoft offerings to the size and scope of their own projects</description>

      <title>Introduction to Azure AI - The Art of the possible</title>
      <description>According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use the Azure AI suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s AI suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from problem to solution.  Multiple demonstrations of the different pieces will show use cases of the AI suite.  This overview of Azure AI will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.</description>

      <title>Creating Near Real Time ETLs Using Serverless Architecture</title>
      <description>Demand for up to the minute data has increased as businesses leverage their reporting to make decisions based on current conditions. This requires a different type of ETL architecture that can consume individual events as they occur instead of bulk processing.

Azure offers several services to fill this need, to the point where the sheer number and variety of them can become confusing. We’ll take a look at these different options individually as well as how they can fit together to create flexible, scalable stream of data.

The focus will be on Azure’s serverless offerings, but other PaaS services will be discussed where they may interact with a serverless design.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Services, and Power BI</title>
      <description>Microsoft Cognitive services is a series of services based on Microsoft Research using Deep Learning techniques, ready for you to enrich your unstructured data. Microsoft Services includes: Vision (Computer Vision, Emotion, Face, Video), Speech/Language (Speaker Recognition, Spell, Sentiment, Language, Key Phrases, Topic detection, Linguistic Analysis), Knowledge, and Search. These services are consumed by using the Cognitive Services APIs. Power BI enables you to consume the APIs to enrich your unstructured data inside your Power BI solutions. During this session, we will cover how to consume the API using Power Query to then visualize the results with Power BI visuals. We will also consume the Cognitive services API by using a R script inside Power BI. This session is structured with a B2C Survey case study solution with a real time Dashboard using a streaming dataset.</description>

      <title>Should This Be Normalized? When Database Normalization Seems Abnormal</title>
      <description>Ever since database normalization was introduced as a concept by Edgar Codd, there has been continuous debate on how far we should go to eliminate data redundancy. A new developer may be asking why there is a need to create multiple tables, and a DBA may be concerned that performance is being sacrificed. In this semi-interactive talk, we’ll discuss 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms, evaluate the pros and cons of normalization and denormalization for integrity and performance, and run through some demos involving scenarios of various data model formats. All to answer the question, "should...this...be...normalized?"</description>

      <title>Applying Data Warehousing Principles</title>
      <description>Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.</description>
