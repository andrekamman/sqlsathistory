      <title>T-SQL Performance Guidelines for the optimal DB stress powers</title>
      <description>To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)</description>

      <title>The Tricky Part of Doing Tricky Things in your Database</title>
      <description>We've mastered the basics of basic database design patterns, but what happens when you or a teammate wants to use THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK to improve on your database design?  Have you just discovered a brilliant new trick that no one else has ever thought of? Or will your new design cost you more, take on more risk and cause all kinds of pain for both IT and your business users?

We'll demo tricks that we've seen in our database design reviews and show you how they work and talk about the trade-offs for using them.  You' learn about: Building a database engine inside your database, Implementing Hierarchies, Dealing with data structures that don't do as well in RDBMSs, Generating code out of the database, 	Optimizing the developer versus the data or the app, 	Using design patterns that don't reflect modern architectures and tools, …and a lot more.</description>

      <title>PaaSport to Paradise: Lifting  Shifting with Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance + Azure Data Factory</title>
      <description>This session focuses on the all PaaS solution of Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance (MI) + SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to lift  shift, modernize, and extend ETL workflows. You will first learn to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – with SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL DB/MI and extend it with custom components. You will also learn to configure SSIS IR to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection. You can then use the familiar SSDT/SSMS tools to manage your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. You will next learn to modernize your ETL workflows by invoking SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines, allowing you to chain them with other activities, automatically (de)provision SSIS IR just in time, store secrets in Azure Key Vault, and splice advanced transformations, such as Power Query Source, Data Quality Tasks, etc.</description>

      <title>High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS</title>
      <description>The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

HA and DR professional Jason Aw with 20 years of experience explains all this and more in</description>

      <title>Data Science with SQL Server Machine Learning Service: Predictive Experiment</title>
      <description>Making data available for data science was considered as very expensive and it was rare to see data scientist works directly with a database for creating experiments. Main reason could be, widely-used languages for data science were not available within DBMSs and DBMSs were not rich enough for experiments.

Good news is, SQL Server Machine Learning Service is now equipped for data science. Let’s have a look on it and see how we can work on training experiments and predictive experiments. Let me show you;
•	What is Data Science and its processes?
•	What is SQL Server Machine Learning Service?
•	Configuring SQL Server for data science
•	Make a training experiment and predictive experiment using Python within SQL Server
•	Consumed a trained model using TSQL

Join with me and see how useful this with both operational and business intelligence areas.</description>

      <title>Automagic Tuning - SQL Server 2019 and Beyond</title>
      <description>Identifying and fixing problematic query plans got a lot easier in SQL Server 2016, with the introduction of the Query Store. SQL Server 2019 takes that power a few steps further. Have you ever:

•    Had a query suddenly slow down at 2 AM when you were on call?
•    Seen a query that received a giant memory grant that brought the rest of the work on your server to a screeching halt?
•    Had the optimizer choose the wrong type of join and send your query off to never finish?

Don’t worry, you will still have your job, but the features introduced in SQL Server 2017 will make narrow your focus to the absolute worst queries in your environment. You will also get a sneak preview of what’s coming into future releases of SQL Server in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap between SSRS and Power BI</title>
      <description>Traditionally, SSRS is used for paginated reports which gives flexibility like drill through reports, subscriptions and print formatting. With Power BI the reports are now more interactive and dynamic. There are still few gaps between these two platforms which are built to purpose. This gap is getting smaller as features are ported between these two platforms. In this session I will be going through various features which are bridging these gaps and point out the differences. These are significant and can affect your decision in choosing the right platform which will fit your needs.</description>

      <title>Get Comfortable with Query tuning and Execution Plans</title>
      <description>Even as many of the traditional DBA activities become automated or managed by Cloud providers, the ability to tune and optimize database query performance remains a desirable and marketable skill.

Central to ability to tune queries is an ability to use information provided from Execution plans, DMVs, Query Store and Extended Events.

In this demo based session we will look into:
- What information is available 
- How it can be used.
- Techniques to improve performance. 

Attendees will leave with an understanding of possibilities of turning queries and a roadmap for further learning.

This session will assume a basic knowledge of T-SQL and execution plans.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Factory: Ingesting and Integrating Data for a Modern Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>When you build a business intelligence system for the current times, such as a modern data warehouse, the mantra for getting data onboard is ELT, and not ETL. Building an ELT solution is not as simple as switching two letter; it is a paradigm shift in thinking. In this session, I will brief you on the concept of a modern data warehouse, then move to why its data integration needs are different, how a solution for such a need is designed, and finally how you would build it using Azure Data Factory, and related technologies.</description>
