      <title>Retail Point-of-sale scenario using Azure Cosmos DB</title>
      <description>Using managed Azure services such as Cosmos DB can help reduce costs by leveraging Microsoft's expertise in globally distributed cloud-scale data storage and retrieval. 

In this presentation we will demonstrate a scenario which is relevant to organizations that need a  scalable and elastic architecture for online order processing or more specifically e-commerce and retail point-of-sale transactions such as orders, payments and bills. 

This scenario takes an event sourcing approach, using a functional programming model implemented via Azure Cosmos DB change feed processor and additional Azure Services. This approach enables high availability and resiliency, geo-replication, and fast performance.</description>

      <title>Temporal Data in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Databases that serve business applications should often support temporal data. For example, suppose a contract with a supplier is valid for a limited time only. It can be valid from a specific point in time onward, or it can be valid for a specific time interval—from a starting time point to an ending time point. In addition, many times you need to audit all changes in one or more tables. You might also need to be able to show the state in a specific point in time, or all changes made to a table in a specific period of time. From the data integrity perspective, you might need to implement many additional temporal specific constraints.
This session introduces the temporal problems, deals with solutions that go beyond SQL Server 2016 to 2019 support, and shows out-of-the-box solution in SQL Server, including:
•	Defining temporal data
•	Application versioned tables
•	System versioned tables
•	What kind of temporal support is still missing</description>

      <title>AI in Power BI</title>
      <description>Collecting detailed data on every aspect of your business is no longer a challenge. Most systems not only expose data through reports, but also allow to read and export it. Still the problem is to understanding fast-growing data sets, detecting valuable patterns hidden in them and using disclosed information to make business decisions. That is where tool like Power BI really shine.
Although Power BI is extremely popular, not many users know that how to take analytict to next level by correctly leveraging advanced AI capabilities.
Artificial Intelligence features in Power BI can be used for data understanding and preparation. During this session we will have a closer look at AI visuals and enrich our dataset using Power Query functions calling Cognitive Services API.</description>

      <title>Automatic database tuning with Query Store</title>
      <description>Query store is new feature introduced in SQL Server 2016. The main purpose of this feature is to simplify the process of performance troubleshooting by tracking the queries being executed on the database over the time. Query store collects metrics for execution plans, query texts, execution statistics and hardware resources consumption over the time. 
Some of the scenarios where the Query Store feature can be useful are:
	• Find the most expensive queries for CPU, I/O, Memory etc.
	• Get full history of query executions
	• Get information about query regressions (new execution plan is worse than the older one)
	• Force specific query plan and Automatic plan correction
	• Automatic index tuning
	• Provide useful insights about needed code improvements
This session will include overview of the Query Store capabilities, configuration instructions and live demos showing the main capabilities. We will also cover Query Store improvements for SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2019 versions.</description>

      <title>AutoML at scale</title>
      <description>Machine learning has become a vital part in many aspects of our daily life and is becoming more and more important. However, the performance of many machine learning methods is very sensitive to a plethora of design decisions. As a result, building well performing machine learning applications requires highly specialized data scientists and domain experts. It turns out that machine learning, a field dedicated to building systems that automatically learn from data, depends heavily on human experts. Isn’t that ironic …
Come and see how Azure Machine Learning Service reduce the demand for data scientists by enabling domain experts to automatically build machine learning applications without expert programming skills and extensive knowledge of machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Query processing in action</title>
      <description>Adaptive query processing improves the quality of a query plan. This helps in selecting the right join, right order of operation and more accurate memory allocation to fit the requested data in the memory. The three techniques of adaptive query processing make SQL Server 2017 significantly faster at processing the workload, even without refactoring the T-SQL Code.

In this session we will talk about the key components of adaptive query processing, Batch mode Memory grant feedback, Adaptive joins and Interleaved execution of table valued functions. We will also discuss the improvements that are coming in SQL Server 2019. Finally we will show how we implemented this on real business case.

Come to learn how we utilized Adaptive query processing module to boost the performance on our most critical calculation procedure.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis with T-SQL</title>
      <description>Transact-SQL language in latest editions of SQL Server has so many business intelligence (BI) improvements that it might become your primary analytic database system. You might even decide to use T-SQL for advanced analyses directly, without including R, Python, SSAS or Azure ML. However, to get the maximum out of these language constructs, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows extremely efficient statistical queries that use the window functions and are optimized through algorithms that use mathematical knowledge and creativity. During the session, the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures are explained as well. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries. Or maybe you want to become a data scientist? Then you need to know statistics and programming. You get the best of both in this session.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Factory v2: Mapping Data Flows - first blood</title>
      <description>Microsoft's services in Azure helps us to leverage big data more easily and even more often accessible for non-technical users. Having UI in ADF version 2 - Microsoft added a new feature: Mapping Data Flow which resembles components of SSIS. This is a very user-friendly and non-code approach tool-set.
But, has that been only UI introduction? Why and how Databricks does work under the hood?
Do you want to know this new feature of ADF and reveal the power of modern big data processes without knowledge of such languages like Python or Scala?
We will review this new feature of ADFv2, do deep dive to understand the mentioned techniques, compare them to SSIS and/or T-SQL and learn how modelled data flow runs Scala behind the scenes.</description>

      <title>Azure Databricks 101</title>
      <description>Many sources? Various format? Unstructured data? Big Data? You might think that these only a buzz words. Not really. These days it's a part of modern data flow architecture. No matter what do you use - SQL Server, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Data Factory, Data Lake... somewhere there you can find Databricks. So, the question is: what the Azure Databricks is and which scenario it could be used in?
Use Databricks to analyse large DataSets at scale, write Python, Scala or SQL command in one notebook to ingest, process and push the data to the required target. Use Databricks' notebook as a part of Azure Data Factory pipeline. We also will try to answer whether Databricks would replace SSIS as a modern ETL/ELT process?

      <title>MLOps – Applying DevOps to Data Science</title>
      <description>While many companies have adopted DevOps practices to improve their software delivery, these same techniques are rarely applied to machine learning projects. Collaboration between developers and data scientists can be limited and deploying models to production in a consistent and trustworthy way is often a pipedream.

In this session, you’ll learn how to apply DevOps practices to your machine learning projects using Azure DevOps and Azure Machine Learning Service. We’ll set up automated training, scoring, and storage of versioned models and wrap the models in docker containers and deploy them to Azure Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service. We’ll even collect continuous feedback on model behavior so we know when to retrain.</description>

      <title>Getting To Know SQL Server Encryption Capabilities</title>
      <description>With stricter EU privacy laws like GDPR, the need to encrypt data is greater than ever.
In this session we'll look at what SQL Server offers in this area:
1) symmetric and asymmetric server encryption which lets the server encrypt table data and control the keys, 
2) Always Encrypted (AE) which works similarly to server encryption but the client control the keys meaning server can't decrypt the data
3) Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) which encrypts your data at rest making getting data from stolen drives useless
4) creating secure SSL/TLS communication channels between your apps and the server to prevent clear text network traffic which can be observed</description>

      <title>Deep Learning advancements and why data is the key ingredient of AI revolution today?</title>
      <description>This session explains how recent development in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes gap between human and machine smaller than ever before.

Traditionally AI systems have been tested in chess and the same has been done to demonstrate the power of AlphaZero. But, instead of playing against human, it played against the best (at the time) chess program Stockfish. It learned about the game by playing a large number of games with itself, learning in the process.

Session will also explain what is so revolutionary in AlphaZero approach to AI and how this new approach can be used in different areas of processing visual information, bio-medicine, autonomous driving, robotics and AI generated images/videos of humans. IoT and large amounts of machine-generated data is the main ingredient of AI today.</description>

      <title>If a computer can understand, why can't YOU understand Azure Cognitive Services?</title>
      <description>Cognitive services can recognise objects, faces, describe images, understand speech, perform advanced searches and so much more.
If you are a developer and know nothing about Azure Cognitive Services for free, this is a good place to start.
Disclaimer: Cognitive services will never guess a doctor's handwriting. That's just impossible.</description>

      <title>Predictive Analysis with SQL Server Machine Learning Services</title>
      <description>R/Python are the leading languages in Data Science and statistics.

In this session we will talk how you can use SQL Server Machine Learning Services (SQL Server R Services in SQL Server 2016), which gives the ability to run R/Python scripts in SQL Server. Avoid unnecessary data movements and execute scripts in-database without moving data outside SQL Server or over the network.

This session will show how Microsoft SQL Server can help meet an increasingly “predictive” world by supporting the R/Python language inside the database.

Demonstration of using R and SQL Server Machine Learning Services.</description>
