      <title>Self-Service Business Analytics in 2013</title>
      <description>In this session, I make the case for Self-Service Analytics as one part of a broader reporting and analytics strategy. On its own, Self-Service Analytics struggles to deliver business users the insights they need, but when combined with a corporate BI platform, the power of Self-Service Analytics shines, and the often toxic relationship between the IT department and the Business changes to one of mutual respect and working together to achieve common goals. After laying the foundations, we'll launch into a range of demos covering PerformancePoint dashboards, SSRS Report Alerts, Report Builder Report Parts, Power View, Pivot  PowerPivot. All demos will show how corporate BI solutions can be extended and enhanced with Self-Service Analytics.</description>

      <title>Introduction to SQL Server 2012 MDS and DQS</title>
      <description>This presentation introduces the upgraded features of SQL Server 2012 Master Data Services (MDS) and the new service, SQL Server 2012 Data Quality Services (DQS).

MDS is a solution for master data management. First released in SQL Server 2008 R2, this upgraded version includes many new features and enhancements, including a new web interface developed with Silverlight, an Excel add-in to support simplified model creation and easier data updates and management.

DQS is a new knowledge-driven data cleansing solution, and it supports building knowledge bases that provide correction and de-duplication of data.</description>

      <title>Windows Server 2012: How It Changes the "SQL Server Game"</title>
      <description>Windows 2012 is out! And it potentially completely changes how you deploy your SQL Server infrastructure.
As a DBA, you should understand Microsoft's new operating system and its important set of features that impact SQL Server and your high availability solution design. 
In this session Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) will present a session on the benefits that Windows 2012 brings to SQL Server, how to install and configure Windows 2012 for a SQL Server deployment, and explore new features that will affect your virtualization and high availability architectures. </description>

      <title>Introducing Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel</title>
      <description>In this session, I will introduce the audience to Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel. "Data Explorer" is an Excel add-in that enhances the self-service Business Intelligence experience in Excel by simplifying data discovery and access. It has often been referred to as the end-user ETL tool, but I believe that it will also be a valuable tool for all technical staff. This demo rich presentation will expose many great features of the newest addition to the Microsoft self-service offering.</description>

      <title>Finding the SQL Server Go-Faster Switch</title>
      <description>In this fast paced world there is an ever increasing need to squeeze extra performance out of your SQL Server environment.  SQL Server will always run well when there are no applications running on it – but when you need to scale the database to thousands of transactions a second what do you do?  In this session Peter Ward from WARDY IT Solutions (www.wardyit.com) will empower you with numerous tips and tricks on to finding the “SQL Server Go-Faster Switch” based on real-world experience from some of the largest SQL Server implementations in APAC.</description>

      <title>Windows Azure SQL Databases - Lessons Learned</title>
      <description>There seems to be a perception that working with Windows Azure SQL Databases is just a case of redirecting your connection strings to the cloud. In this session, Greg will explain why that isn't the case, explain what is and isn't provided by WASD, and detail lessons that he has learned from working with this environment.</description>

      <title>Achieving Infinite Scale with HDInsight</title>
      <description>The traditional approach to database scalability has been to simply buy a bigger box. However with the ongoing data explosion that is occurring in organisations today there is a need to re-think how to achieve scalability for the database platform. In this session we will explore how to extend the scalability of Microsoft SQL Server by using HDInsight and how to achieve scalability as a Hybrid solution using the Azure platform. With nothing more than a credit card and the Azure platform you will see how it is now possible to create highly-available, infinitely scalable SQL Server environments that support automated deployment and elastic scale. </description>
