      <description>I have been in IT since 1999 as an administrator, an analyst, an architect, a developer and, most recently, a manager for Elliott Tool Technologies LTD in Dayton OH. I have been managing and developing in SQL since Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 and have also handled applications running on Oracle, MySQL and IBM Universe. I guess you can call me a SQL addict. Fortunately, Elliott uses an ERP and other systems driven by MS SQL, and so my obsession for SQL can be quenched daily.</description>

      <title>ETL from the Trenches: SSIS in the Real World</title>
      <description>Sure you've read the SSIS books. And sure you've seen a lot of SSIS presentations. But how do you put it all together to create a solid ETL framework for loading your data warehouse environment? In this (updated for 2010) session, we'll look at the ins and outs of a real-world ETL environment built using SSIS. We'll discuss the ETL design patterns used to handle a multi-tiered data warehouse environment with multiple data sources, different loading schedules, and different data transformation requirements. We'll also discuss how the development team responsible for the ETL environment at the Department of Veterans Affairs handles package auditing and logging, team development, package testing, and automated deployments.</description>

      <title>Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers</title>
      <description>  An often-overlooked aspect to data optimization is what is happens under the covers – how does SQL Server store and access data?  There are plenty of common rules covering tuning, but this session looks at data access from the physical layer, detailing how table access and indexes work, showing why some designs perform poorly, and why adding more indexes may not help.  This will not be a discussion of normal forms or design rules. Instead, it will be a technical session providing the foundation for you to choose which concepts to apply to your designs.
  The session starts with the notion that SQL Server is not a magic box – most of what happens is well-documented and must be taken into consideration when designing or tuning databases.</description>

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).</description>

      <title>Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services</title>
      <description>Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.</description>

      <title>Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits</title>
      <description>Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!</description>

      <description>SQL Azure allows you to host your data in SQL Server in the cloud. That provides some big benefits in scalability and management. However, it leaves open the question, “How do you get your data into / out of the cloud?” At some point, you are going to need to move data to or from an on-premise store to SQL Azure. In this session, we’ll discuss the available options for this, including SSIS, the Sync Framework, and BCP. We’ll cover the pros and cons for each. We’ll drill into one of the options, SSIS, in detail, and review performance options and potential issues that you may encounter when doing this.</description>

      <title>Manage SQL Server System and Performance Data with</title>
      <description>Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Buiding a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

      <title>Become a Bilingual DBA! Oracle for the SQL Server </title>
      <description>In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two. </description>
