      <title>Data Storytelling Using Power BI</title>
      <description>In today's world, data is omnipresent and most organizations are presented with billions of data points every morning. Good analysis parses these numerical outputs into an understanding of the organization or process. In short, it “humanizes” the data by turning raw numbers into a story about the performance. The challenge is to interpret these stories correctly and for that, we need the help of data visualization tools like Microsoft Power BI. 

Join me as I take you through on how to utilize Power BI effectively to tell data stories and engage your audience. Watch and learn some of the top techniques and hacks on making aesthetic as well as relevant Power BI reports for effective storytelling. Also, watch out for some engaging examples of storytelling using Power BI (which also includes the winning report of the Microsoft Power BI Best Report contest!)</description>

      <title>Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?</title>
      <description>R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

In this session I will focus on the benefits of using R in Power BI. I will show how to leverage R for data munging and I will also show how to leverage R to create custom visualizations. I will focus on the quot;Wickham stackquot; which is a group of very popular R packages developed by Hadley Wickham. I will discuss logical use cases for using R within Power BI as well as some of the pitfalls that you may encounter.</description>

      <title>Are You Making False Assumptions about Your Data?</title>
      <description>When starting on a new data project, the first step is usually to interview stakeholders and subject matter experts who list the many assumptions that they have been making about the data in the organization. Unfortunately, these assumptions are rarely 100% true which can cause a significant amount of troubleshooting and bug fixing later in the development process.

In this session, we will build a general purpose solution to this problem. Starting from a list of assumptions encoded in an Excel workbook, a collection of SQL statements to test the assumptions are automatically generated. The results of these statements are visualized using PowerBI to create a completely interactive analysis tool to validate assumptions, and diagnose the assumption violations when they are encountered. 

Even better, a solution to automate and orchestrate this entire process using SSIS and Biml will also be presented. All code for the solution will be provide to attendees for free use in their projects.</description>

      <title>Use Biml to Automate SSIS Design Patterns</title>
      <description>Perhaps you’ve heard the buzz about Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) and wondered, “Why is everyone so excited about Biml?” Occasionally, a new technology emerges that changes everything. For SSIS developers, Biml is one such technology. Biml is a powerful solution for rapidly creating SSIS packages and solutions. SSIS Design Patterns support various load profiles. Combined, Biml and SSIS Design Patterns offer a compelling solution for automating enterprise data integration.

In this session, you will learn: 
-	How to rapidly build multiple SSIS packages using Biml
-	How to apply different SSIS Design Patterns using Biml
-	How to automate SSIS Design Patterns using Biml</description>

      <title>Incrementally Moving to the Cloud Using Biml</title>
      <description>Many organizations are interested in the cost savings, ease of maintenance, and other benefits of hosting data solutions on Microsoft Azure.  For most, moving to the cloud is easier said than done, especially when they have a large existing solution that is being actively used by stakeholders.

In this session, we will examine various strategies for incrementally moving your solution to the cloud. This will include strategies that incorporate the use of:
1) New value-added features and services, such as machine learning and big data
2) Hybrid approaches where portions of your existing solutions can be moved to the cloud without requiring everything to be moved
3) Failover and surge approaches that enable the cloud to supplement on premises resources
4) and much more

Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) will be central to our approach, enabling the rapid movement of assets back and forth between on premises and cloud hosting.

All code will be shared with attendees.</description>

      <title>The 20% of DAX That Gets You 80% of the Way There</title>
      <description>For those of us coming from a SQL background It's easy to get intimidated by DAX.  It's a weird language meant to appeal to Excel people while also mimicking much of the functionality of MDX.  This session will cover the topics that will make you productive immediately with DAX.  Those topics are 1) Calculated Columns v. Measures, 2) Implicit vs. Explicit Measures, 3) the CALCULATE function, 4) Time Intelligence,  5) CUBEVALUE.  This is truly the 20% of DAX that will make you productive in 80% of situations.  We're going to start with a working data model and start building calculations right away - bring your laptop.</description>

      <title>Advanced MDX scripting: Scope statements and Time Intelligence</title>
      <description>Most Analysis Services (SSAS) cubes use an MDX script where additional calculations beyond the basic physical calculations are defined.

In this session you will learn about adding calculated measures to the cube using the cube's MDX script. Then you will learn about Scope statements, how to use them to implement conditional logic, and how they affect physical and calculated measures differently. Finally you will see some examples of time intelligence functions such as YearToDate and MonthToDate implemented using Scope statements. 

The session is for those who are familiar with SSAS and have had some exposure to MDX syntax and concepts.</description>

      <title>Tips and Tricks for the SSIS Catalog</title>
      <description>With the introduction of the SSIS Catalog in SQL Server 2012, we can now manage our SSIS package execution and monitor performance and logs in a much easier manner than executing packages from the file system.  In this session, we'll walk through setting permissions for SSIS read-only access, executing packages from T-SQL or stored procedures, viewing the logs generated during a package execution, writing custom messages to the logs, and many other tips to make your use of the catalog easier!</description>

      <title>Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml</title>
      <description>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour long presentation, Scott Currie from Varigence will use the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Scott will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. This will include the creation of *hundreds* of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to R for Power BI</title>
      <description>R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, or you can use it to create custom visualizations. In this session I present easy to follow examples of those 3 scenarios. I will also provide resources that will enable you to take what you learned to the next level.</description>

      <title>Unlock the Power of the SSISDB for Dynamic Package Runtime</title>
      <description>In this session, we will be demonstrating how to leverage the SSISDB to change SSIS Package parameters at runtime using just T-SQL. This strategy makes it easier when deploying packages to both QA and production since things like connection strings, file names, and destination table names can change based on the environment you are in. We will show how to change all these features dynamically at runtime, so that you can deploy the package once, and configure it on the fly with just T-SQL.</description>
