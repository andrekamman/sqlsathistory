      <title>Active Directory and Azure Active Directory: Authentication in a Cloudy World</title>
      <description>If you're planning on deploying Office 365 or Azure, whether you know it or not, you will be using Azure Active Directory (AAD). But, you've already got on-prem Active Directory. How do these two products work together? Are they the same thing? SHOULD they work together? In this session I'll answer these questions, compare and contrast AD and AAD usage in Azure and hybrid scenarios, discuss costs, and some best practices.
This is a beginner session, but there will be some networking involved, in addition to "legacy" AD functionality and settings.</description>

      <title>45 Minutes to Your First Tabular Model</title>
      <description>Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the Azure Analysis Services product? Power BI's data modeling? These technologies are all effectively the same, but live in different places and can serve different roles. Now's the time to dive in and figure all of this out.
In this session, we will talk about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various "flavors" it comes in. We'll explore development processes and will wind up with a model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.</description>
