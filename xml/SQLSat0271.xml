      <title>Interview Tips</title>
      <description>Have you been asked for an interview for that perfect job? The job that you
would love to have on a team that you really want to be a part of? It is
time to sharpen those interview skills. Every interview is different. During
this session we will talk about my observations from many interviews that I
have been a part of. There are many examples in this session on how not to
present yourself, during an interview. We may laugh at some of the
observations, but there are many lessons to learn. Get an inside look at how
hiring managers make decisions, and make sure you know what to look for as
the candidate. Have you been tasked with conducting an interview? We will
complete the session with some tips on how to make sure that you get the
information you need to make a good decision.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?</title>
      <description>When I was getting started with SQL Server, I struggled with poorly performing queries.  I’d spend a lot of time trying to tune the code, but didn’t always make good progress.  Soon, I learned that query performance isn’t just the way the SQL is written, it’s also how the indexes are designed and the statistics collected by those indexes.  Even then, for far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  But I found out there’s a lot more to statistics than just row counts.   In this beginner session, we'll touch on how statistics are created, the different types of statistics, how they’re maintained, and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on finding out additional information about your statistics.  We’ll use plenty of examples and demos to make it all clear.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data, so that you can write queries that perform better.</description>

      <title>Scripting in SSIS</title>
      <description>SQL Server Integration Services is full of useful and versatile tasks, components, and containers that allow the ETL developer to easily handle most data movement and transformation issues. However, it's not uncommon to run into ETL need that require more flexibility than what is offered in the native tools of SSIS. Fortunately, Integration Services comes with a couple of tools to overcome most any ETL challenge: the Script Task and the Script Component.

In this session, we will explore both the Script Task and Script Component tools within SSIS. We will discuss the reasons why one might need to include scripting as part of an ETL strategy, as well as examining some use cases where scripting is a good fit. We will follow up with several demonstrations of how to solve specific ETL challenges using the Script Task and Script Component in SSIS.</description>

      <title>Possible Musics:  Choosing between Analysis Services 2012 Multidimensional and Tabular</title>
      <description>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models, developed by business users, to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect, SSAS Maestro and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "flythrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchy of Monitoring Needs: A Methodology</title>
      <description>When it comes to the servers in your environment, do you feel alone, afraid, and in the dark ?  If we want to know if our servers are healthy, where do we start?  It's very easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when you have hundreds, if not thousands, of metrics you can monitor in SQL Server.  The Hierarchy of Monitoring Needs provides a clear roadmap for designing your monitoring strategy.  This session will review monitoring from a high level, helping you develop a plan from the ground up by addressing critical metrics, business needs, and your overall strategic goals.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Execution Plans</title>
      <description>You just received a phone call from your boss telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is underperforming, hogging resources or timing out, the first thing you want to examine is the query execution plan. An execution plan provides a wealth of information that can help you quickly diagnose what is wrong. In this beginner level session you will learn what an execution plan is, how to find it, and how to interpret it to see what the query optimizer is doing and find the major pain points</description>

      <title>Extended Events In Real Life</title>
      <description>Extended Events, introduced in SQL Server 2008 are here to stay. When combined with the fact that Profiler for Trace is a deprecated feature we're going to need to learn how to use Extended Events to monitor our server. In this session we're going to step through some real-world uses of Extended Events including diving into the backup process (on single and multi-stripe backups), Availability Group event monitoring, and insight into the DBCC CHECKDB process (NEW IN SQL 2014)! </description>

      <title>Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is 
deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is 
made up of a lot of objects in different environments. When you create an 
object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed 
into each environment. Together we will discover how to separate each 
object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have 
changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable 
deployment and version control process.</description>

      <title>Master the Date Dimension Like a Time Lord</title>
      <description>All data warehouses need a Date dimension to enable analysis by date. Most DW designers will just use a default one provided by the tools, but what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any Date dimension you want by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary to update the dimension. By the end of this session, you’ll be a Time Lord in your own company!</description>
