      <description>Greg Moore is a graduate of RPI. There, he majored in CompSci, but probably spent as much time hiking, canoeing, caving and rock-climbing as he did studying.
He started working with SQL Server 4.21a in 1995 and has survived numerous upgrades.
He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.</description>

Or do you just think it would be fun to present but you are too nervous to try it?  Well take the first step to becoming a presenter by attending this session and I will guide you through the process of learning to present and becoming good at it.  It's easier than you think!  I am an introvert and was deathly afraid to speak in public.  Now I love to present and it's actually my main function in my job at Microsoft.  I'll share with you journey that lead me to speak at major conferences and the skills I learned along the way to become a good presenter and to get rid of the fear.  You can do it!</description>

      <title>Full Text Indexing Basics</title>
      <description>Abstract:

Today’s large data fields (LDF) are full of unstructured information stored in varchar, text, varbinary or xml data types. How do you write an application to search the column for patterns? Traditional SQL techniques using a column INDEX and LIKE operator result in a query plan that contains a full table scan.

I will be introducing the brother’s grimm database that has the full text of each fairy tale. I will create a full text catalog / index, select a change tracking strategy, define optional stop list / thesaurus file, and then populate the index. I will use CONTAINS and FREETEXT operators in SELECT queries to leverage the FTI. This resulting query plan performs index seek.

Coverage:

1 – Creating a database from scratch.
2 – Creating a table with LOB field.
3 – Loading files via BULK INSERT.
4 – Performance via traditional techniques.
5 – Creating a full text index.
6 – Performance with the full text index.
7 - Using FTI in a Azure SQL database.</description>

      <title>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</title>
      <description>Abstract:

Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?

This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Coverage:

1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?</description>

      <title>An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2016</title>
      <description>With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.</description>

      <title>Networking: it isn't just for breakfast anymore</title>
      <description>Networking.  You keep hearing that word throughout your career development, but you don't know much about it, much less, how to do it.  You want to connect with technical and data professionals, so you attend events such as SQL Saturday and your local user group.  But what about your book club, your gym, your church group, or your kid's soccer game?  Those are prime -- and overlooked -- opportunities to network!

In this interactive session, we will discuss networking -- what it is, why it's important, and where opportunities exist.  You will even have an opportunity to practice networking within the confines of our room.  You might even leave this session with new networking contacts that you didn't previously have!</description>

      <title>Whoa! Backup, what happened? The Basics of Backups</title>
      <description>This session will start with performing a basic backup and restore of a database and then discuss the difference between FULL, Differential and Transaction backups. From there I will discuss many of the available options for backups, including backups of specific database files, to multiple files and different restore options.

Many DBAs still setup their backups via a GUI and “fire and forget” and don’t think about backups and restores until too late. This session will show you while that works in many cases, for larger or more complex databases, or databases with specialized HA requirements, the out of the box solution may be far from optimal.</description>

      <title>From (User) Story to Tables: Read Between the Lines to Find Your Data</title>
      <description>If you work in an agile environment, design requirements often come to us as stories with the phrase: "As a type of user, I want to ..."

For example: As a DBA, I want to be able to break down user stories to understand how they translate into our current database design and usage and have an understanding as to how it will affect future needs.

That user story is also the goal for the session. This will present one approach to how we can think about these user stories to find the data that we need to design our databases for. We'll even work through an example together. 

This is for DBAs who are involved in any part of designing databases, who want to practice how to come up with database designs, or who just another way to think about how they approach their database development in general.</description>

      <title>BI Infrastructure in Azure: Points to Consider</title>
      <description>Success of a good BI infrastructure is measured by two most important factors: 
a) Better access to data and 
b) Increased operational efficiency
How can you set up your own BI infrastructure in the cloud to address these? 
What components do we consider?
We can do that by proper selection of technology and vendors from Azure Market Place. How do we keep an eye on possible use of Big Data for your BI. We will also look at the best practices for doing so. We will take a fleeting look at some of the storage options for us in Azure and some Big Data concepts as well.
We will learn about Copy Data Virtualization in Azure Market Place that can help you provision terabytes worth of information in matter of minutes. 
We will also learn about setting up teams and ways to train them(and yourself) in this fast evolving world of Azure.</description>

      <title>Query Optimization Techniques</title>
      <description>How often have you been told that an application is running "too slow"?  This statement is the cause of a great deal of investigation, frustration, and dead-ends for database professionals.

The problem won't always be a bad query, but when it is, knowing how to dive in, diagnose its performance, and resolve the situation efficiently will turn a potentially frustrating situation into a fun one!  Using that knowledge in development to prevent future performance issues will improve script quality and application design, while making your future self less burdened by performance emergencies.

This is an opportunity to identify common query mistakes and learn a variety of ways in which we can solve them.  This discussion will include query rewrites, indexing, statistics, database design, monitoring, execution plans, and more!

Demos of poor-performing queries will be provided to illustrate key optimization techniques, design considerations, and the tools you need to fix them.  Fast.</description>

      <title>Performance Troubleshooting made easier - new features in Management Studio !</title>
      <description>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools.  Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.  

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows? 

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan.  You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.</description>

      <title>Big data architectures and the data lake</title>
      <description>With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!</description>

      <title>WIT Luncheon: Women Participation at Conferences/Workshops/Technical Market</title>
      <description>Technical conferences generally have a paucity of women speakers. Many have none at all, some have a token woman, and most have a minority around the 10% mark. Only a very few conferences have a strong minority (&gt;25%) of women speakers. Conferences with "soft" subject matter such as web design, user interfaces, or community management tend to have higher proportions of female speakers than those with "harder" subject matter.

We’ve assembled a panel of presenters and women in tech to delve into the causes, solutions and provide tips for women or diversity of speakers at technical conferences.

This session will be presented by Capital Region Women in Technology:

      <title>Development  Test Data Management: Achieving breakthrough saving</title>
      <description>An estimated 2,000 new applications are released daily yet, the demand for new applications is increasing. Resulting in enterprises that lack sufficient resources to meet demand. Costly storage, compute and licenses required to maintain multiple copies of production databases are scarce. Delays in development cycles result as developers wait for DBAs, who in turn wait for storage administrators to provision the required space. The business suffers as project delays lead to deferred revenue or customer service impact. Actifio virtualizes production system data, delivering instant, non-disruptive access for application development and test without the need for additional storage. Virtually multiplying the output of a production environment, while simultaneously reducing costs. This session will provide an understanding of how to utilize Actifio for application development and test
data automation to reduce application development cycle time, reduce costs and eliminate production impact.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2016 (SP1)  2017 ROCKS!!</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016 SP1 is probably one of the top 3 announcements for SQL Server ... EVER!! Many previously Enterprise Edition only features were opened up to lower SKUs, including SQL Express! Memory usage scenarios changed DRASTICALLY too! And SQL 2016 itself "Just Runs Faster"!  This session will be a medium-to-high-level overview of these absolutely incredible changes.  We will also talk about some of the awesomesauce released in SQL Server 2017 too! If you are like most entities and NOT on SQL Server Enterprise Edition you WILL want to be on SQL 2016 SP1 or 2017 after hearing this talk!</description>
