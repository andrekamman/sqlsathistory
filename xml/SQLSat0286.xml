      <title>SQL 2012 Table Compression</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</description>

      <title>Clustered Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2014</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 introduced columnstore indexing but with one major drawback -- columnstore indexes were not updateable.  Thus, adopting them to improve data warehousing (or other) query patterns took careful planning and quite a bit of management.  SQL Server 2014 introduces clustered columnstore indexes that are now fully updateable!  During this session, we'll take a look at how clustered columnstore indexes work, what implications exist for using them, and how the update process is handled.  We'll also take a look at what management and maintenance operations are required to keep clustered columnstore indexes performing optimally.  Anyone with a large data warehouse environment (or even an OLTP or ODS database with very large tables) will definitely want to attend!  </description>

      <title>Best Practices for Efficient SSRS Report Creation</title>
      <description>You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn't it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you'll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mock-ups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. 
Reports don't stop changing once they're released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn't it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We'll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.</description>

      <title>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</title>
      <description>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</description>

      <title>Crazy Things That Developers Do</title>
      <description>Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn what we do (from opening up the database to SQL Injection attacks, how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries, and the pitfalls of using NOLOCK), why it's bad to the database server (or your career)... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.</description>

      <title>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

      <title>"So you have a performance issue.  What now?"</title>
      <description>You're a new DBA, want to be a DBA or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings.  Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  Their query or stored procedure took a very long time to run.  Can you help them?  Do you even know where to begin to help them?  Most sessions I've attended on performance tuning seem to start in the middle.  They take the approach that the audience has some understanding on how or where to start.  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow".  </description>

      <title>Designing a Restore Strategy</title>
      <description>Do you back up your databases? If the answer is yes (and I really hope it is), do you test your restores? If a table gets dropped at 1:53PM, can you restore the database to 1:52PM using log backups? Can you use the WITH STANDBY parm to apply log backups to a read-only copy of a database?

For the answers to these questions and a whole lot more about database restores, plus some nifty scripts, join me for this presentation.</description>

Thankfully the transaction log is there and we can all breathe easier.
In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses the transaction log to maintain the durability and consistency of its data, along with methods for reading the transaction log and identifying active transactions.

      <title>Optimizing Protected Indexes</title>
      <description>As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.</description>

      <description>Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Database Deployment</title>
      <description>The easiest part of any deployment is running the deployment script on production. But what have you done to prepare that script for production? Was the script tested? Is the script tightly coupled with the application code? The difference between a successful deployment and a failed or problematic deployment is all the preparation work you've done to ensure that you're deploying the right script, the right way to your production environment. This session will explore best practices that you can implement to ensure that your deployments are as successful as they can be.
