      <title>SQL Development in a Developer's World</title>
      <description>Database development tooling is evolving to meet the demands of modern application development methods, including automated pipelines, cross-platform environments, and multi-dimensional architectures.  Whether you are familiar with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or new to SQL projects, the SQL Database Projects extension is worth a look because it combines the Azure Data Studio interface with declarative database development capabilities. Beyond Azure Data Studio, the command line application SqlPackage.exe is a powerful tool for extracting and publishing database schemas. Add in a little magic* and let your imagination run wild with the opportunities to create efficiencies in your development workflow.

      <title>Performance Improvements in SQL Server 2019</title>
      <description>Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 in November.  The latest version contains several improvements and new features that improve reliability and performance.  First, Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) completely redesigns the SQL Server database engine recovery process.  This allows the time spent recovering from a crash or rolling back a transaction to be greatly reduced.  ADR also prevents the transaction log from growing during a long-running transaction.  Second, metadata for temporary tables can be stored in in-memory tables.  For tempdb-heavy workloads, this removes a bottleneck and provides an improvement to performance.  Finally, SQL Server 2019 supports the use of persistent-memory (PMEM) devices.  PMEM can be used to persist the transaction log buffer, effectively removing LOGWRITE waits.  Join me for this session to learn about these new features in SQL Server 2019 and how they can make your workload run faster.</description>

      <title>What SQL Server DBAs Need to Know About Docker Containers</title>
      <description>You have been given new responsibilities to automate deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications – not just SQL Server databases. But you feel stuck and overwhelmed because you have so much to figure out. The available information on the internet isn't helping and you're wasting so much time trying to learn things on your own. Even worse, you end up being a stressed, overworked DBA who wished you could focus on the “cool stuff”, but are instead stuck in firefighting mode while juggling the additional workload.
In this session, get introduced to SQL Server on containers and what you need to know to start deploying and managing them. You'll learn the different components that make up the container ecosystem and how to leverage containers for faster SQL Server deployments.</description>

      <title>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</title>
      <description>Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?  This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Techniques:
1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?</description>

      <title>Modern T-SQL for Better Performance</title>
      <description>Once you learn how to write queries, it’s easy to fall back on the same old patterns. You need to get the job done, and using old techniques is often quicker than learning something new. Over the past decade, Microsoft has released several versions of SQL Server with T-SQL enhancements, and many of these enhancements not only let you write queries easier, the queries also run faster. 

Join this session to learn how this “new” T-SQL functionality can save you time when writing queries that also perform great.</description>

      <description>SQL Server provides several several security features for developers and architects.  Features such as Dynamic Data Masking (DDM), "Always Encrypted", and Row-Level Security provide an additional level of security natively through the database server.  We'll explore the implementation of these features on the client/server for data in transmission or at rest.  In addition, we'll examine built-in features and custom implementations.</description>

      <title>How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment</title>
      <description>Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any areas that may be impacting performance or security. During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. During this session we will cover a number of additional tools that can be used, include the Vulnerability Assessment Tool and a suite of 125 SSRS reports the return key data needed in a manner easier to read and export.</description>

      <description>Yes, there is AI built right into the Microsoft Power BI Desktop.  This session will guide you through adding more Intelligence to your BI reports! 

Power BI is masterful at helping designers create storytelling reports that provide answers to the questions of “What has happened?” and “What is happing right now?”  We can even get some insight as to “What will happen?”  BUT what if you want to know “Why something happened? Or “How can we alter what will happen?”  With the built in AI tools, we can start the journey getting answers to our “Why” and “How” questions answered. 

In this session we will review the following Power BI Desktop tools:

      <title>Dynamic SQL: Writing Efficient Queries on the Fly</title>
      <description>Dynamic SQL is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of fast and efficient queries when the specifics may not be known until run-time. This tool can be used to automate complex processes, facilitate reporting on an unknown number of targets, or perform tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming to develop.

This is an often misunderstood tool that is underused in areas where it can provide immense value or abused by applications that it was never intended for. Well-written dynamic SQL can solve seemingly impossible problems while being easy to read and understand.

Applications that will be demonstrated include: mapping database relationships, schema searching, generating large volumes of TSQL, and much more. Explore the many uses for dynamic SQL as well as best practices for writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining it!</description>

      <title>Surviving the work from home burnout</title>
      <description>After the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 I began the work from home experience. It was a time of uncertainty in the world and I became the lab rat of working from home. It was the beginning of a trend that will eventually culminate in the norm during this 2020 pandemic.   I had to reinvent myself without a guide and eventually burned-out. My physical and mental health slowly deteriorated until I decided to learn more about the human body and the way energy is processed.  I want to share my experience with others and help them reduce burnout and become highly productive.</description>

      <title>Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques</title>
      <description>When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.</description>

      <title>I lost my job!  Now what?!?  A survival guide for the unemployed</title>
      <description>You've just been told by HR that you are no longer a part of their organization.  You've been kicked to the curb.  You are now living in the no-man's land called unemployment.

Unemployment is a scary situation.  You're dealing with emotions and uncertainty.  You don't know if you'll be out of work for days, weeks, or months.

Fortunately, unemployment is survivable.  In this session, I'll share my own experiences (and perhaps we'll talk about some of yours) with unemployment, and how I managed to get through the tough times.  We'll discuss emotional impact, the job hunt, and things you can do to get yourself through this tough time.  Hopefully, you'll land on your feet once again before long!</description>

      <title>Getting Started as a Conference Speaker</title>
      <description>Conference speaking is a very rewarding way to give back to the community. Just getting on stage is often the most challenging part. We dig into questions that people struggle with. 

How do you decide on a topic? 
How do you get past a phobia in public speaking? 
What if someone asks a question you don't know? 
How do you connect with your audience and get them to engage with you?

I'll teach you how to construct a successful talk and point out things you need to be aware of each step of the way. You will walk away with the tools to help you squash the butterflies and make your experience a success.</description>

      <title>Building a Security Dashboard for SQL Server</title>
      <description>If you have a SQL Server, you need to secure it. However, even the most robust security is useless if you're not monitoring it. How else would you know whether something has changed? Or whether something isn't working as expected? And frankly, for monitoring, you need a quick view of the data you've collected. Enter dashboards.

In this session, we'll discuss what information you need to collect from your SQL Servers to effectively monitor security. You'll also see how to build a simple security dashboard for your own use using Power BI.</description>

      <title>Launch a Cost-Effective Mentoring Program</title>
      <description>Your technology organization needs a mentoring program!

- It's easier than you think.
- You can do it now.
- You don't need special skills.
- It's inexpensive to start.
- The benefits are measurable and substantial.

The key is to keep the business goals for the program at the forefront. When mentoring and learning become vital, expected parts of work, and when you measure results, you're headed for success.

I'll show you how I started and nurtured a mentoring program at SJV Data Solutions. Participants included software developers, managers, and product professionals. In under a year, this program improved products and advanced careers. The positive effect on the bottom line was unmistakable. The program's benefits far exceeded expectations. Plus, a well-designed mentoring program scales; most weeks, I spent under two hours running the program.

Conducting this mentoring program is the most rewarding thing I have done in my tech career.  I can't wait to share these ideas with you!</description>

      <title>SQL Server Configuration with dbatools and dbachecks</title>
      <description>Automating the configuration of SQL Server instances and being able to check the configuration for standard configuration is an important role for any DBA when you have lots of instances.  But how can we automate the configuration easily?  How can we check to make sure the proper configuration is in place and hasn’t changed?

In this session, we will look at how to configure your SQL Server Instances using PowerShell and the dbatools module.  Then we will look at how to use dbachecks to confirm the configuration of our instances and how to check for changes in the future of the configuration. 
 
Attendees will see how easy it is to use PowerShell via dbatools to configure their SQL Server instances.  Attendees will see how easy it is to use PowerShell via dbachecks and PowerBI to see if their servers are configured properly.  Attendees will be given a set of scripts that take back to use to configure and test the configuration of their SQL Server instances.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing explained with demos!</title>
      <description>This talk is inspired by the quantum revolution we will see in a moment.
I would like to introduce the topics:
- reminder why basic linear algebra (matrices and vectors) is important
- qbits, superposition, and quantum logic gates
- Show the simplest problem where a quantum computer outperforms classical methods

If time permits - quantum entanglement

I will do demos implemented in Q# with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.

I do not assume any special knowledge, but if you know basic linear algebra (matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication) than the topic will be more easily understand!</description>
