      <description>Greg Moore is a graduate of RPI. There, he majored in CompSci, but probably spent as much time hiking, canoeing, caving and rock-climbing as he did studying.
He started working with SQL Server 4.21a in 1995 and has survived numerous upgrades.
He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2016 Migration:A Technical/Project Management Approach</title>
      <description>Just imagine that the management has given you an annual goal, to upgrade/migrate a SQL environment to SQL 2016(or 2014) and no project manager is available.  After this session you will be able to create a quick  dirty project plan and handle similar projects with ease and confidence.

We will start by discussing the ten Knowledge Areas and five Process Groups in a Project Management Framework. Each of these in turn, has multiple inputs/outputs; and each of them has multiple tools. Then we will learn how all these map to a SQL Server upgrade/migration project.  

Most projects fail due to ‘Scope Creep’ , bad Stakeholder Management and poor communication. We will learn how to handle each of these along the way towards a successful completion.

Finally we shall discuss a relatively new concept of a ‘Go Live’ environment that will help you save hundreds of hours of work and help you complete your SQL Server migration project “In Time In Budget”.</description>

      <title>Think like the Cardinality Estimator</title>
      <description>SQL Server uses a phase during query optimization, called cardinality estimation (CE). This process makes estimates bases on the statistics as to how many rows flow from one query plan iterator to the next.  Knowing how CE generates these numbers, will enable you to write better TSQL code and in turn influence type of physical operations during a query execution.  Based on that estimated rows, the query processor decides how to access an object, which physical join to use, how to sort the data.  Do you know how the CE generates these numbers?  What happen when you have multiple predicates, range predicates, variable values that are “NOT KNOWN” to the optimizer or you have predicate values increasing in ascending order? Do you know what will happen if your predicate is using a value that is outside of histogram range?  In this session, I will show you how CE estimates in all of these scenarios and you will walk out better equipped to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.</description>

      <title>Leaving the Past Behind: Rewriting Your Checklist for SQL 2016</title>
      <description>How big should the page file be for Windows Server 2016? How many data files should SQL Server 2016's TempDB contain? What trace flags should we use by default now?
 
These are questions you addressed long ago in your setup checklist. You've spent a lot of time with that checklist, and you're sure it's perfect. Or is it? When was the last time you visited that checklist?  Does it make sense for SQL 2014? What about SQL 2016? Change is hard, and DBAs need to constantly challenge yesterday's best practices to ensure they meet today's business needs.
 
Join veteran DBA Mike Hillwig and his list of server administration best practices that need to be revisited for modern versions of SQL Server, especially SQL 2016.</description>

      <title>Managing Azure Resources with PowerShell</title>
      <description>PowerShell is the robust automation language for Windows. When extended with the Azure modules, you get a robust automation platform for Azure.  In this talk, we’ll explain how to create, inquire about, and manage Azure resources with PowerShell.  We’ll discuss the greatly improved Azure portal featuring Resource Manager which allows us to group resources together and what that means for our PowerShell development.  For those not using Azure Active Directory, we’ll explain how to create a Service Principal which is an application account so unattended PowerShell jobs can authenticate without human interaction.  Beyond Azure scripting, we’ll review ways to maximize the extensibility and reusability of your PowerShell code by creating custom modules, functions, and configuration frameworks.  If you plan to use Azure, you need PowerShell, the Azure automation language.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Data Flow: Exploring SSIS Transformations, Memory and the Pipeline</title>
      <description>SQL Server Integrations Services is a robust product, with lots of different options available to the ETL developer. One of the main components in SSIS is the Data Flow task. For someone new to SSIS, it can be daunting to be assigned a project to extract data from a source, transform it and then load it into its intended destination. What components do I use? Why pick one over another? Even if you are new to SSIS, it's good to have an understanding of what's going on under the hood when a data flow task is run. Come to this session to learn what non blocking, semi blocking and fully blocking transformations are. We'll explore how SSIS creates and manages memory buffers. You'll leave with a better understanding of how certain tasks and transformations can affect your package’s performance.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server</title>
      <description>It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

In this session you’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. We will cover writing simple unit tests and look into more advanced topics such as faking tables and spying procedures. We will also look at how unit testing improves code quality and maintainability.

You will leave this session ready to write unit tests for your own environment to get started on the way to a defect-free and maintainable SQL Server code base.</description>

      <title>SQL Server High Availability in Azure IaaS</title>
      <description>Deploying mission critical SQL Server in Azure IaaS requires an in-depth understanding of storage, virtual networks, load balancers, SQL Server AlwaysOn and more. To qualify for Azure’s SLA of 99.95% availability, steps must be taken to mitigate downtime by leveraging Fault Domains and Update Domains in conjunction with traditional HA options.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) replaces Azure “Classic” as the preferred deployment method in Azure. New features such as Deployment Templates and Resource Groups introduced in ARM make it a powerful tool in managing the entire life-cycle of SQL Server in Azure.

In this session attendees will learn how to leverage ARM to deploy SQL AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Cluster Instances. Template Deployments and manual configurations using the Azure Portal and Azure PowerShell will be demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Network your Way to Success!</title>
      <description>Did you know that most employers  -- whether looking for a full time employee, contractor, or consultant – interview people because of their technical skills and experiences, but hire and keep them for their social capital?  In times of economic downturn, it’s not the person who is the most competent who stays; it’s the one who’s most competent, likeable, and connected.   Socially adept people also get invited to the table more often for big projects and are promoted (or extended) more frequently than purely ‘competent’ individuals. 

Whether or not you’ve been in your role for a few months, years, or even decades – or you’re looking for a new job and new opportunities -- strategic networking is the way to make yourself more relevant, more attractive for projects and promotion – or more hirable by potential customers.  

Join us for an interactive session to strategize the best actions to increase your social capital and network your way to success!</description>

      <title>Architecting Availability Groups</title>
      <description>Are you a DBA familiar with some basic Windows clustering and database mirroring concepts, and now you're considering AlwaysOn Availability Groups? This session is for you! I'll cover the pros and cons of four typical configurations of AlwaysOn Availability Groups: stand-alone instances, fail-over cluster instances, multi-subnet configurations, and disaster-recovery-on-the-cheap. I'll also discuss read-only routing, and implications and limitations of the Availability Group Listener. In addition, you'll learn why you should be using Windows Server 2012 R2 or above for your Windows clusters. Join me to learn which configuration options you should choose for your Availability Group.</description>

      <title>Whoa! Backup, what happened?</title>
      <description>This session will start with performing a basic backup and restore of a database and then discuss the difference between FULL, Differential and Transaction backups. From there I will discuss many of the available options for backups, including backups of specific database files, to multiple files and different restore options.

Many DBAs still setup their backups via a GUI and “fire and forget” and don’t think about backups and restores until too late. This session will show you while that works in many cases, for larger or more complex databases, or databases with specialized HA requirements, the out of the box solution may be far from optimal.</description>

      <title>Outsourcing database administration to your users.</title>
      <description>How outsource administrative tasks to your end user groups in a safe, secure, and repeatable pattern.   Now you no longer have to pause and stop what you are doing to create that new login, and replicate it to your Disaster Recovery.   You do not have to stop and perform a backup/restore to refresh the development environment.  Empower your end users, let them do this on their own without compromising your security.

There will be a demo!</description>

      <title>Utilizing Docker to create developer instances for SQL Server.</title>
      <description>SQL Server has come to linux. While there are certainly use cases this on production, the one thing any enterprise can take advantage of immediately is quickly spinning up development servers as docker containers.

In this session we will go over the basics of docker, as well as the SQL Server For Linux docker image. We will talk about how to use docker and docker-compose to create a development instance of our production server as well as loading test data on it. We will go over the challenges of hosting a database server in a docker container.</description>

      <description>Learn how to install a new SQL Server instance in less time than it takes to get a latte at Starbucks. 

My team manages hundreds of SQL Server instances, and performs dozens of installations every year. By automating our SQL Server install, each new server requires just a few minutes of effort before they are ready for use. Even if you only install a few SQL Server instances every year, introducing automation will save you time, and ensure a more consistent configuration. 

I will share my automation script, and show you different methods to add automation to your installation routine.</description>
