# Merge Replication for High Availability
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#108---Redmond-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Queen Anne
## Speaker: Diane Robey
## Title: Merge Replication for High Availability
## Abstract:
### Load balancing web servers between database servers enables high availability when using merge replication. When one data center has a power failure, the HVAC is down or other disaster, the web hosting and databases at the other data center can take over new connections along with the existing connections and continue with the entire load. Upgrades and equipment maintenance are more convenient when another data center can easily take over. There are limitations and specific procedures for setup and maintenance. Discover the benefits and caveats of merge replication.

# Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#108---Redmond-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Pioneer Square
## Speaker: Kevin Kline
## Title: Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on
the market. But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy. And it doesn’t mean that
database administration on SQL Server is problem free. And since SQL Server is constantly
growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues
that others had tackled and solved years ago. Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails
of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. In
fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?

Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Pioneer Square
## Speaker: Merrill Aldrich
## Title: PowerShell 101
## Abstract:
### If you haven't dug in to PowerShell at this point, you're missing out on some amazing, powerful, practical stuff that could save you time every day. PowerShell does have a learning curve at the outset, especially for those not already familiar with OO concepts or programming in a language like C#, so this introductory session will go through the very basics of PowerShell syntax. If that collection of pipes and hyphens and curly braces seems to be written in some incomprehensible foreign language, this session is for you. At the end of the session you should have a grasp of how and why a PowerShell script does what it does, and the confidence to dig in deeper and begin using POSH scripts in your own work.

# Parallel Task Scheduling with T-SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#108---Redmond-2012)
Event Date: 25-02-2012 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Queen Anne
## Speaker: John Huang
## Title: Parallel Task Scheduling with T-SQL
## Abstract:
### It's not so difficult to write a stored procedure to execute number of tasks (SQL statements) sequentially and/or conditionally. However, things will become complex when you decide to run the code blocks within the procedure from different sessions concurrently with desired ordering and definable degrees of parallelism. In this session, we will discuss different ways to implement thread schedulers, semaphores, synchronizations, and process ordering as well as process monitoring and manipulation by using pure T-SQL.
