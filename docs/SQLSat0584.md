# Statistics and New Cardinality Estimator Model
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#584---Colorado-Springs-2017)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Susantha Bathige
## Title: Statistics and New Cardinality Estimator Model
## Abstract:
### Statistics in SQL Server plays a major role creating execution plan which essentially decides server performance. If you get a good execution plan the server performance is good otherwise it will impact negatively on the server performance. SQL Server 2014 introduced new Cardinality Estimation (CE) model to improve the quality of the execution plans via quality estimates of row counts. The new CE model is a major redesign to the Query Optimizer since SQL Server 7.0. In this session, I'm going to talk about how statistics is used to generate the execution plan, how execution plan changes with new CE model with demos.

# Seeking the Perfect Hybrid:  On-Prem Data with Reports and Dashboards in Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#584---Colorado-Springs-2017)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Seeking the Perfect Hybrid:  On-Prem Data with Reports and Dashboards in Power BI
## Abstract:
### For many new Power BI implementations, initial self-service and team objectives are soon met, and the natural evolution of Power BI turns to an organizational focus.  In other scenarios, the enterprise seeks to preserve its investments in "classic BI" by integrating Power BI with Analysis Services and the underlying data warehouse.

In this session, Data Platform (SQL Server / BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson explores the construction of organizational BI solutions, wedding the "traditional" solutions with the reporting and analysis power of Power BI.  We'll focus upon the components of a "traditional" solution, up to the semantic model (with SQL Server Analysis Services as an example), and then explore paths to the implementation of an end-to-end enterprise solution that uses Power BI as the presentation layer.
This session applies, in most respects, to Analysis Services 2012 and above.

## Title: Disaster Recovery Where to Begin
## Abstract:
### So you have a good backup strategy in place, but now you have to think about a disaster recovery.  Where do you start and what are your options?  SQL Server offers several options, but then how do you choose the right one to meet your business requirements?  In this session, we will go over some of the common DR options including log shipping, replication, mirroring, clustering, and AlwaysOn.  Then we will talk about how to choose the best one to meet your business needs.

# Data Integration: the neglected hero of your information environment
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#584---Colorado-Springs-2017)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Information Delivery
## Speaker: Scot Reagin
## Title: Data Integration: the neglected hero of your information environment
## Abstract:
### Every organization struggles to ensure data is up to date and consistent across multiple systems.   Often this results in the development of layers of system to system data integrations or repetitive and manual processes intended to support operational and reporting needs.

Enterprise Data Warehouses and Marts are often the only stores that provide single point access to data sourced from multiple systems - but these stores can be expensive and complicated to build and maintain and tend to lag behind business need.

Data Lakes offer the promise of fast inexpensive data acquisition but without specialized tools lack the structure that makes their data accessible and useful to the business.

A managed Data Integration platform can provide both efficient data management across systems and a shared, single point, store of data sourced from all participating systems.   A Data Integration platform solution is not technology or tool specific and can provide immediate and continuing value.

# Accelerating DevOps and TDM Using Data Virtualization
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#584---Colorado-Springs-2017)
Event Date: 25-03-2017 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Tim Gorman
## Title: Accelerating DevOps and TDM Using Data Virtualization
## Abstract:
### DevOps is the merger of app development, testing, and IT ops.  All tasks from coding to testing to operations must be automated so that new features and fixes can be continuously delivered.

Test Data Management (TDM) is the optimization of the process of software quality, ensuring that applications properly work according to their specifications.

Constraining both DevOps and TDM is data, which has grown enormous and complex. "Storage is cheap" is not merely a lie, but beside the point. It takes a lot of time to push terabytes around from place to place, and time is expensive.

Provisioning a full environment for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each might require terabytes of storage. So, everyone is limited to working in a small shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, and code quality suffers, and the pace of delivery fails to live up to requirements.

Data virtualization is the solution.  Come learn.

## Speaker: Patrick Geselbracht
## Title: Power BI on  Azure Analysis Services
## Abstract:
### The level of effort to integrate a tabular SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube with Power BI became significantly easier with the release of Azure Analysis Services. Setup, configuration and maintenance of an On Premise gateway for direct query and scheduled data refreshes is no longer required. Leveraging the default Azure Analysis Services integration with Power BI, developers can focus on modeling cubes and creating beautiful dashboards and reports. In this session, we will explore the setup of an Azure Analysis Services as compared to the use of as an On Premise Analysis Services data source for Power BI. 

We will discuss modeling  security patterns in Analysis Services in conjunction with Power BI. We will also demonstrate a direct query connection of On Premise and Azure Analysis Services cubes to Power BI. Additionally, we will highlight leveraging Power BI functionality including reports, dashboards, and QA of an Analysis Services data set.

## Title: Get Into the Goldilocks Zone: Managing SQL Transaction Log VLF Growth
## Abstract:
### Are your transaction logs ballooning? Are the VLF numbers out of control? What can you do about it? 

Let's start with "what's a VLF and why do I care?" and move forward into learning how to shrink VLFs (a temporary solution) and how to resize SQL Server transaction log files (a more permanent solution) for greater server stability, better performance during server startup, backups, and restores, and to minimize storage space requirements.

The SQL Server transaction log is a critical piece of SQL Server's ability to ensure that data is maintained exactly as the user input or modified the data. The transaction log must, at times, grow in size in order to do its job. When a transaction log’s growth gets out of control (too large, too many segments), then SQL Server’s ability to perform as it should is negatively impacted. Too-large transaction log files cause longer database start up, backup and restore times, and will require more storage space on disk. Learn how to control VLF gro

## Title: Intro to Azure SQL Databases
## Abstract:
### Azure SQL Databases are still something that is new and not completely understood by many data professionals. There is a definite shift from installing SQL Server on a machine to creating and using a Microsoft's Platform-as-a-Service database. This session will cover the basics of what an Azure SQL Database is, how we create one, and what it takes to access and use this database. After attending this session, you will have a solid understanding of what Azure SQL Database is, how to configure it, and how to use in your own environment.
