## Title: Graph Databases–How and Why
## Abstract:
### We, as data professionals, are dealing with increasingly large amounts of data. And, increasingly, we're asked to generate insights from this data. For that, the relationships between data points matter more than simple aggregations of individual data points. In our interconnected world, interconnected businesses, interconnected applications, graph databases lend themselves to answering relationship questions far more easily than...relational databases.

In this session we'll look at graph databases for
	how to model graph databases
	how to easily express relationships between interconnected data
	how to efficiently retrieve interrelated data 

We'll look at the MATCH predicate in T-SQL and the MATCH statement in Cypher, the query language for Neo4j.
