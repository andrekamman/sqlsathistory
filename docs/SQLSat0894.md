# Making the leap from Excel formulas to DAX
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#894---Perth-2019)
Event Date: 07-09-2019 - Session time: 15:35:00 - Track: Analytics and Big Data
## Speaker: Wyn Hopkins
## Title: Making the leap from Excel formulas to DAX
## Abstract:
### DAX is easy until it's hard.   The same thing applies to Excel formulas.   The advantage of Excel is you can see exactly which cells are being referenced and you see the immediate answer of your calculation.
DAX formulas are written in isolation with the author having to "picture" the context of where that calculation will be used.
This session compares and contrasts calculations in Excel formulas and DAX formulas to give you a better comprehension on how to tackle DAX.
Tips, tricks and best practice ideas will set you up for more powerful Excel and Power BI reporting.

# Smart Alerts for Azure SQL Database using Automation  Logic Apps
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#894---Perth-2019)
Event Date: 07-09-2019 - Session time: 15:35:00 - Track: Application, DBA and Database Development
## Speaker: Martin Cairney
## Title: Smart Alerts for Azure SQL Database using Automation  Logic Apps
## Abstract:
### If you've dipped your toe into the waters of Azure SQL DB, you'll know that there's no SQL Agent available. Fortunately there are many options available to get you over this hurdle. One of these is Azure Automation, a scheduling engine which runs PowerShell or Python scripts to perform your tasks. As a bonus, these Runbooks can also be triggered from Azure SQL DB alerts. This session will introduce Azure Automation, from a basic, manually executed Runbook to an alert-driven responsive utility that can save you considerable effort. We'll then take Alert responses a step further and use them to trigger an Azure Logic App workflow - a utility that provides a robust workspace with built-in scalability  retry logic along with a multitude of connectors which can expand the response to your alert. Imagine being able to capture an Alert, perform the remedial action, log the issue  response in your ticketing system and switch on your kettle so you can sit back and let Azure do it all for you.

## Speaker: Jason Aw
## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS
## Abstract:
### The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me?

# Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#894---Perth-2019)
Event Date: 07-09-2019 - Session time: 15:35:00 - Track: Application, DBA and Database Development
## Speaker: Hamish Watson
## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer
## Abstract:
### Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 

TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.

In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 

A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code
