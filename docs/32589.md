## Speaker: Rob Volk
## Title: Revenge: The SQL!
## Abstract:
### Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker?  Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge?  WRONG!

This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them.  (But they deserved it!)  Learn how to:  create tables with no names; columns with duplicate names; and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL.  You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!
