# Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#611---Orange-County-2017)
Event Date: 01-04-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Rick Lowe
## Title: Why should I care about ... the plan cache?
## Abstract:
### SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.

# CONVERT_IMPLICIT is a hidden danger
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#611---Orange-County-2017)
Event Date: 01-04-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker: Alex Grinberg
## Title: CONVERT_IMPLICIT is a hidden danger
## Abstract:
### Abstract: The CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator is part of an execution plan. When an execution plan has a CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator, this is a signal that “your statement has a problem”. This presentation will show you how to detect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator; how to find the statement that causes conversion, and what DMVs can help to solve the problem. It will also show you the solution to collect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator across the servers.

# APPLY Yourself
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#611---Orange-County-2017)
Event Date: 01-04-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: Database Development
## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: APPLY Yourself
## Abstract:
### Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.

## Title: No Schema, No Problem! – Introduction to Azure DocumentDB
## Abstract:
### This session presents an overview of Azure DocumentDB, Microsoft's massively-scalable, fully managed NoSQL database platform designed specifically for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports a schema-free data model and scales easily. But it also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios.

We begin by explaining NoSQL and document databases, and how they compare with traditional relational database platforms. Then we tour the many features of DocumentDB, including rich querying with SQL (that’s right, you query this NoSQL database using SQL!), and client development using the REST API and the DocumentDB SDKs. Next, learn about the server-side programming model and write fully transactional stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. Also explore tunable consistency, scale-out partitioning, custom indexing, attachments, and more. Attend this session, and get up to speed on DocumentDB to

Event Date: 01-04-2017 - Session time: 16:00:00 - Track: BI Architecture, Development  Management
## Speaker: Ted Stathakis
## Title: Reporting Services 2016: New Features  Smart Migration Strategy
## Abstract:
### With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting  Services is finally getting some love!  In this session you will get a brief peek at some of the new features and functionality including a look at the new Report Manager interface and the new control we have over the parameter placement on screen.

We will then dive into how to use a custom report, based on the ReportServer database transaction log table, to see which reports are actually being used and use that report to determine a smart strategy for which reports to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  You will see how to combine this understanding of active reports with the power of linked reports to simplify your Reporting Services implementation as you convert to SQL Server 2016.

The session will conclude with a look at my “Ultimate Footer”, which you can use on any version of Reporting Services, that shows report utilization, performance details, stored procedures and data sets used and discover any inline TSQL being abused.

## Speaker: Mickey Stuewe
## Title: Redgate Source Control
## Abstract:
### It has been a long established practice to keep maintain application code in version control. Versioning your application code allows you to view changes made by several developers working on the same project. It allows the team to get the latest changes in a consistent and reliable manner. It allows you to return your code to a prior state. It even acts as a safety net for when that day comes when your developer’s computer won’t turn on.

So, what about your SQL Objects? 

Join me in this demo heavy session where we will explore the benefits of versioning your SQL Objects and learn how it can enable streamlined database development without sacrificing control and visibility. We’ll be using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control tool for demos, and we’ll see how it integrates with your existing version control software to manage your SQL Objects just like application code.

## Title: Why are you still taking backups?
## Abstract:
### Keep doing things the same way because they have always worked in the past is a very comfortable mistake we all make in many areas. That includes backup strategies and service account administration. In this one hour presentation full of demos I will explore many options available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure that can potentially reduce the amount of data and time required for backups and even eliminate the need all together. It sounds scary but it will be really fun.

## Speaker: Deji Akomolafe
## Title: Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere
## Abstract:
### Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First"; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question?  Bring it!

## Speaker: Lori Edwards
## Title: SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?
## Abstract:
### For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014  2016.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.

## Title: SQL Injections and How to Stop Them
## Abstract:
### Right now, there are hackers all around the world trying to get into your web applications. How safe are you? By using a technique called SQL injections, hackers can wreak havoc on web applications by compromising security, manipulating data, choking system resources, retrieving sensitive information, and modifying database objects. Without proper precautions, attackers can even drop databases! 

During the demo, we will take on a couple of different roles. As a hacker, we will walk through steps a hacker might take to compromise a web application in order to retrieve sensitive data such as credit card information, usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. Assuming the role of a developer, we will then show various prevention techniques and their effectiveness in preventing SQL injections.
