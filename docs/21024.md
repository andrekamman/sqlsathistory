## Title: SQL Server's In Memory Database Objects
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 14 is continuing to expand on the in memory database features that were first introduced in SQL Server 2012.  During this session we will explore the new in memory database tables which were developed under the code name project hekaton.  During this presentation the scope of the feature will be discussed as well as reviewing the use cases and best practices for using in memory database tables and when the in memory database tables shouldn’t be used.
