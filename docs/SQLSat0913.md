# SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-913)
Event Date: 12-10-2019 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Paul Stanton
## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
## Abstract:
### DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

## Speaker: George Bryant
## Title: Give me an "M"! Give me another "M"! Give me a... Ok you get the point.
## Abstract:
### The language commonly known as "M" (or Power Query to some) has grown in prevalence over the last 5 years to where it has evolved into a fully integrated language in various tools from far in the front end to way in the back end. Power BI uses it heavily. Cubes can call directly to it.

Come along and learn how the language works and some proposed best practices. With a focus on Power BI optimization but watch as I delve into Data Lake ingestion to Azure Analysis Services and so forth.

# Azure Security, Cost, and Capabilities
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-913)
Event Date: 12-10-2019 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Ross McNeely
## Title: Azure Security, Cost, and Capabilities
## Abstract:
### Security, cost, and capabilities are the key questions for any Azure project. Nothing should be implemented today without a tested security surface. Creating a strong and flexible identity perimeter will allow for secure access. Platform security will create a secured perimeter for all of your cloud resources from Virtual Machines and Networks to resource locks and permissions. Manage customized security alerts, and configure a playbook for specific threats. Configure security for data infrastructure, and data encryption at rest. Implement security for applications such as certs, monitoring, and security baselines. Data and applications will not last long if costs are not managed from the beginning. You will need to monitor and analyze the cost of your Azure resources as soon as development begins. Azure Cost Management allows you to create a budget. The biggest factor in security, and cost management is implementing the right capabilities to support your business requirements.

# MongoDB and SQL Server 2019: The Odd Couple
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-913)
Event Date: 12-10-2019 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Peter Kral
## Title: MongoDB and SQL Server 2019: The Odd Couple
## Abstract:
### Microsoft is pulling out all the stops when it comes to SQL Server 2019 integration with "Big Data" solutions. With the expansion of PolyBase to handle external data in MongoDB, moving data from "unstructured" documents into relational tables in SQL Server is theoretically simple. However, MongoDB is designed to allow for spontaneous schema changes. Our fussy SQL Server won't like such sloppiness! In this session, we will explore SQL Server 2019 features, such as PolyBase, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and T-SQL features such as JSON support, that facilitate integration with MongoDB. The demonstration will include moving data between our Odd Couple of database paradigms, and building in safeguards to keep the two systems from having issues. Can two incompatible databases share data without driving each other crazy?

# Pseudo-Constants in SQL
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-913)
Event Date: 12-10-2019 - Session time: 09:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Riley Major
## Title: Pseudo-Constants in SQL
## Abstract:
### You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.

## Speaker: Adam Anderson
## Title: Environment Setup using automation tools like Docker, Powershell and Chocolatey
## Abstract:
### Environment setup in some organizations can take days and even then it is not consistent and has components missing or configured incorrectly. These problems can be solved and this session will cover several techniques for doing just that. In this session we will use Docker to create 3 SQL environments. The first is a production like environment for UAT. In the second environment will redact the confidential data and in the third environment reduce the dataset by 90%.

This three tiered environment setup can work with or without Docker. In this session we will also cover using Chocolatey NuGet's, which sounds tasty, but it is also a very powerful method of installing software on Windows.

## Title: Power BI Dataflows - What do you mean it's about storing data?
## Abstract:
### Power BI Dataflows are an emerging technology from Microsoft in the Power BI space (not to be confused with Azure Data Factory Dataflows, of course). Power BI Dataflows are emerging as some features are still in preview. The part that is not clear in the name is that this is not purely and ETL function. Power BI dataflows allow you to store data in Azure Data Lake. Depending on how you configure your solution, you can use the Common Data Model as well. Let's dig in an create a dataflow using native Power BI functionality then we will look at using an existing ADLS as well.

## Speaker: Tim Plas
## Title: Azure SQL Database Managed Instance - Almost But Not Quite the Same
## Abstract:
### Let's talk about Managed Instance, the newest member of the Azure SQL Database family. It's a WHOLE lot closer to out-of-the-box SQL Server than other flavors of Azure SQL DB. But it's still got some differences. Do those matter for you?  What exactly is it? What is it good for (or not)? How much does it cost? Just how compatible is it with existing systems? How can I move data in and out of it? How is my data protected, for HA, DR, and backups? What else do I need to know about it?

Bottom line: Does Managed Instance make sense for me?

# An Introduction to Partitioning
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-913)
Event Date: 12-10-2019 - Session time: 13:30:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Kevin Krenz
## Title: An Introduction to Partitioning
## Abstract:
### Large tables in SQL Server present challenges on several fronts. For query performance, avoiding accessing data unnecessarily becomes more important. For ETL, loading and modifying data while utilizing compute resource and avoiding lock contention becomes more difficult. For maintenance, making efficient use of resources and time presents challenges. 

In this session, we will introduce the core concepts of partitioning in SQL Server -- partitioning columns, partition schemes, and partition functions. We will configure heaps, rowstores, and columnstores as partitioned tables, and execute queries to compare how they access data. Finally, we will work with the requirements for switching partitions in and out of tables.

After this session, you will be able to configure partitioned tables, explain how partitioning affects query execution, and switch partitions in and out of tables.

## Speaker: Andrew Brobston
## Title: Hands-On Query Tuning Workshop
## Abstract:
### You know query plans can help you fix T-SQL performance issues, but maybe you aren’t sure of all the ways query plans can help.  Maybe you use index suggestions, but you wonder if you could do better.  Maybe you’ve never used a query plan at all.  Come to this workshop and learn!

Let’s roll up our sleeves and dig into some T-SQL performance work.  We’ll work together to examine query plans and enhance query performance.  Feel encouraged to take part in the conversation, no matter your experience level.  We’re all here to learn!

You’ll get even more out of the session if you bring a device that can use OpenVPN (if you have SQL Server Management Studio or another client) or remote desktop (if you don’t).  You can then experiment on your own to discover suggestions for the group and see improvements for yourself.

When you leave the session, you’ll have more practical ways to fix slow T-SQL the next time you run into a real-world performance problem.

# Control PHI and Sensitive Data Risk for Self-Service BI using Power BI DataFlows and Azure Data Lake
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-913)
Event Date: 12-10-2019 - Session time: 13:30:00 - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development  Administration
## Speaker: Greg Beaumont
## Title: Control PHI and Sensitive Data Risk for Self-Service BI using Power BI DataFlows and Azure Data Lake
## Abstract:
### Protected Health Information (PHI) and other forms of sensitive data are an area of concern in all industries. Highly regulated industries such as Healthcare and Financial Services have a great deal of person-specific information in their systems, and often restrict the use of self-service Business Intelligence (BI) to prevent the wrong people from seeing the wrong data. This presentation will review new ways to safely enable self-service BI for an enterprise without introducing additional risk of PHI or sensitive data violations. I'll review strategies and architectures that include Power BI DataFlows with Azure Data Lake to eliminate sensitive data from a self-service BI environment. An infrastructure leveraging these tools can still have highly controlled and governed enterprise Power BI reports that carefully distribute PHI and sensitive data to targeted users, while also enabling self-service BI without an increased risk of sensitive data violations.

## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Maximum SQL Server on VMware Performance
## Abstract:
### Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed and managed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your VMware-based SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance will be discussed and the knowledge gained will help you work with your infrastructure engineers so you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Managing ETL Change Using BIMLScript
## Abstract:
### Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata? Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. 

To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data. I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.
