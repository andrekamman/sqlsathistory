## Speaker: Eric Selje
## Title: Unit Testing Fundamentals 
## Abstract:
### How can you be certain the "little change" you're about to make to that stored procedure isn't going to take down your whole company? "Real" developers use a technique called "Unit Testing" to minimize that risk, a concept that's also available to you. With unit testing you can quickly ascertain whether the the changes to functions, stored procedures, and even other objects in your database had a negative unforeseen impact.

In this session we'll walk through the basics of what unit testing is, how to set up a simple Unit Testing project in SSMS, how we can tell whether something has negatively changed in our functions or procedures.  We'll then introduce the tSQLt framework to run our test suite as well as SQL Test from RedGate.

## Speaker: Eric Ness
## Title: Data Mining Deep Dive: Clustering
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server makes it simple to apply data mining algorithms to a wide variety of data.  Applying the results to business decisions without a thorough understanding of how the algorithms work is dangerous to the bottom line of the business, though.  This session will take one of the algorithms, the Microsoft Clustering Algorithm, and do a deep dive into the mechanics of how it works.  The algorithm is valuable for analyzing data in the fields of marketing, social networks and many others.  The session will also examine the types of data that are valid for clustering.  A demonstration of building a clustering model using SQL Server Analysis Services and viewing the model using the Excel Data Mining Add-In will be given.

Event Date: 12-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Keller 3-180
## Speaker: Kirby Richter
## Title: Implement a Dynamic Table Partitioning Solution
## Abstract:
### Have a large or potentially large database that you would like to partition?  Manually implementing partitioning and the corresponding maintenance can be a lot of work, especially if you have many tables.  In this presentation we look at how you would implement a partitioning solution dynamically for all tables with the designated partition column.  We set it up to keep a FIXED number of file groups.  The partition maintenance will recycle the file groups over time as partitions are dropped and created.  We do as much as possible through dynamic scripting.  This solution can easily be used for archiving but in this example we are simply keeping the most current 6 months of data and dropping the rest.  Assumes you have a basic understanding of SQL Server table partitioning.

## Speaker: Mark Vaillancourt
## Title: DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting
## Abstract:
### Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.

## Speaker: Mark Knutson
## Title: The care and feeding of your adolescent SQL Server.
## Abstract:
### Many organizations bring SQL Server into their environment and evolve in their use of it in a similar manner. They may start with extensive use of Microsoft Access and Excel data stores and bring in SQL Server to address the limitations of these products. They may bring in SQL Server to support a departmental application development initiative, or to start a BI project. A developer or server administrator may be pressed into service as a DBA, and as the project or use of the server increases, an improvisational approach to managing the server starts to get cumbersome.
At this stage in the organization’s use of SQL Server, there are a few simple things that can prepare the server for its increasing role in the organization:

## Abstract:
### An in-depth session examining "Waits" happening in your SQL Servers, using the well-known "Waits  Queues" methodology. 

With particular focus in the session on understanding and interpreting the information found the (DMV) sys.dm_os_wait_stats, 
Taking note of which “Waits “with the highest counts or excessive wait times, as well as those which “Waits” can be safely ignored, 
We can discover those "performance hurdles" and ways to overcome or remove them, restoring your SQL Servers performance levels. 
By using established methodologies like “Waits  Queues”, we can systematically identify and remove performance

#### [Back to calendar](#nr-238)
Event Date: 12-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Keller 3-180
## Speaker: Rick Krueger
## Title: Temporary Objects Without Permanent Consequences
## Abstract:
### Temporary objects like Table Variables and Temporary Tables are not inherently bad, but they are overused and misunderstood by many. Increase your understanding and learn when you should favor a Temporary Table over a Table Variable. We will start with the basics, but also look at execution plans to get a better grasp on the cause of those performance differences. Table-Valued Parameters are implemented as read-only Temporary Tables under the covers, and have some solid use cases. Discover how Table-Valued Parameters can be used to: 1) avoid the dynamic sql used by application code (or t-sql string splitting functions) to allow multi-value selection and 2) dramatically reduce the number of round trips between an application and SQL Server.

# Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-238)
Event Date: 12-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Rapson 56
## Speaker: Russel Loski
## Title: Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript
## Abstract:
### Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.

## Title: SSRS data driven subscription using SSIS
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services provides a powerful tool to render report based on information in a database table. But in order to use this feature, you are required to purchase an Enterprise license of SQL Server. In this session, we will create an SSIS package that renders reports to the file system based on values stored in the database.

## Speaker: Steve Hughes
## Title: Beyond Power Pivot - Building Tabular Model Solutions
## Abstract:
### So  you have built this awesome Power Pivot model and deployed it SharePoint.  Now you need additional security or better processing strategies.  What do you do?  Migrate the model to a SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular Model.  In this session, we will explore those features that make the Tabular model more robust than a Power Pivot model.  We will walk through migrating and updating a solution to take advantage of security, partitioning, and other Tabular model capabilities.

# Agile Data Warehouse - The final frontier

Event Date: 12-10-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Rapson 56
## Speaker: Terry Bunio
## Title: Agile Data Warehouse - The final frontier 
## Abstract:
### Come to this session and learn about why you should always create a data model for enterprise applications. This session will review the benefits and functionality that typically is provided by most data modeling tools. Learn why a data model needs to be more that just a collection of SQL scripts. Many projects try to version their models in a manually manner by generating SQL change scripts and checking them in. This labour intensive process frequently turns out to be not scalable and does not integrate well into the  development process. This session will also share a process that was used to version database changes directly from a data model.

## Speaker: Ben Thul
## Title: Back(up) to Basics
## Abstract:
### Are your databases being backed up? Are you sure? Are you sure they're being backed up correctly? Maybe you're an "accidental DBA" or a developer who's not quite sure of the answers to those questions. In this session, you'll learn what the different types of basic backups are, how to execute them, and (perhaps most importantly) how to restore from them if and when necessary.

## Speaker: Tim Plas
## Title: Data Migration Between SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### Data must often be relocated to a different SQL server, when consolidating or upgrading servers or databases. This session details experiences from numerous such moves, using a number of different techniques. We talk about why you might do such a thing, which approaches are available (with what trade-offs), and some of the things that sometimes get forgotten. And especially, how to handle SQL-based apps for a move.

## Speaker: William Weber
## Title: They Say We Shouldn't, But Let’s Do It Anyway – Ad
## Abstract:
### You know all of those things that people say you shouldn't do with Tabular models; many-to-many relationships, parent-child hierarchies, actions, etc? Let’s do those! In this session we’ll work through a few scenarios to implement some of the more advanced SSAS Tabular techniques. Not only those things that we often hear we shouldn't do (though there’s often a business case to do them), but also those advanced aspects of Tabular models and the DAX language like dynamical security, using inactive relationships and implementing a direct query model that aren't as frequently implemented. Come join me to try out all of the things we shouldn't.
