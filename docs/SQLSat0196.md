Event Date: 20-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 3
## Speaker: David Smeets
## Title: Data-driven Subscription using SSIS and SharePoint
## Abstract:
### SQL Server Reporting Services provides data-driven subscriptions to render reports based on information in a database table. This is a very nice feature but the down side is that you are required to purchase an Enterprise license (or BI license in SQL 2012) of SQL Server in order to use this feature. Customers like this feature but don't want to pay for the Enterprise license so I searched for an alternative with standard licenses. In this session I will show the alternative where the end user can still create his own subscription in SharePoint. Step-by-step  I will create an SQL Server Integration Services package that renders reports to a SharePoint library on values stored in the database.

# The Power of Custom Assemblies in Analysis Service
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#196---Denmark-2013)
Event Date: 20-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 4
## Speaker: Jens Vestergaard
## Title: The Power of Custom Assemblies in Analysis Service
## Abstract:
### Sometimes you are stuck with customer demands where common solutions just aren't scalable
within the Analysis Services (SSAS) regular toolbox. This is where custom
assemblies come to save the day!  Custom assemblies allow you to extend
the power of SSAS by using other technologies, as in this case T-SQL and the
SQL Server relational engine.

This session will demonstrate how to utilize custom assemblies in Analysis Services to leverage the
power of the relational engine and use it directly in MDX. Through the .Net
framework and T-SQL we will be able to inject dimension member unique names
into MDX. Effectively we are replacing the MDX Crossjoins with the T-SQL Inner
joins, whereby gaining scalability and consistency in query perfo

## Speaker: Kennie Pontoppidan
## Title: SQL anti patterns
## Abstract:
### You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.

## Speaker: Mark S. Rasmussen
## Title: Storing Character Data Optimally
## Abstract:
### So you need to store character data in your database? Easy enough, you just create an nvarchar(MAX) field and you're done, right? It turns out, it's not so simple. First up you need to decide on a data type - should you use text? Char(100)? Varchar(100)? Or perhaps one of the (MAX) types? I'll go through the options we have, including a deep dive on how each data type differs in its storage on disk. Knowing this, we can make intelligent decisions on which type to use, as well as predicting actual performance implications. Knowing how to store character data optimally is an absolutely critical part of your job as a DBA.

Event Date: 20-04-2013 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Track 1
## Speaker: Denny Cherry
## Title: Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running
## Abstract:
### Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting (as time allows).
