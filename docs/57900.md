## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Big Data, Small Data, and Everything In Between
## Abstract:
### The breadth of options available to data professionals today is staggering:  between relational, object, graph, and document databases, we have a wide array of storage options, as well as a huge number of access and analysis tools.  This talk will walk you through data platform, data analysis, and data processing options.  We’ll discuss when to use (and when not to use) Spark, R, Storm, and SSAS, as well as a range of other tools and technologies.  By the end of this talk, you may not have MongoDB or Neo4J, but you will know where they might fit.
