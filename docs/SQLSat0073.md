# Partitioned Tables: Management  Query Processing
#### [Back to calendar](#nr-73)
Event Date: 09-04-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Tech 100
## Speaker: Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Partitioned Tables: Management  Query Processing
## Abstract:
### You are implementing partitioning because you want easier management for very large tables and indexes and want to improve your data loading, deletion and archival operations. But you also need to know the query processing implications and understand how partitioning will impact your existing queries. On the other side, many developers believe that the primary purpose of partitioning is to make your queries run faster. This session will show you the reality and will focus on both how to implement partitioning to achieve better maintenance and data availability and how it will impact query processing, including potential issues, benefits and recommendations.

## Speaker: Joseph Verftido
## Title: (SSIS, TSQL) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Match) 
## Abstract:
### We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSS). Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms.The steps are as follows: 1. Cleansing and standardization 2. Group records 3. Split records 4. Compare records and determine scores 5. Split into separate match categories 6. Analyze results of matches 7. Evaluate using match tools to determine if best algorithms have been combined.

# Designing Re-Startable SSIS Packages

## Speaker: Peter Kral
## Title: Designing Re-Startable SSIS Packages
## Abstract:
### SSIS provides the Checkpoint functionality for recovery after a package failure, but many experienced SSIS developers eschew it because of its lack of granularity when restarting a failed package. Sometimes the restarted package will execute tasks that had partially succeeded previously, causing data consistency issues or outright data destruction! In this session, you will see SSIS package design that allows predictable, scalable recovery after a partial or complete failure during execution. Intended for experienced SSIS developers with knowledge of SSIS Expressions and T-SQL.

## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: Become Bilingual! Oracle for the SQL Server DBA
## Abstract:
### In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### In the words of Brent Ozar (www.BrentOzar.com), "You can't be a great SQL developer without using Test Driven Development.  In the words of Grant Fritchey (www.ScaryDBA.com), "Test Driven Development with SQL Server made me want to tear my hair out."  Testing in T-SQL may be more cumbersome than in other development languages, but eventually all software must be tested.  How can you thoroughly test a data-dependent application without testing the data pieces that drive the application components?  If the database has problems, they will eventually affect the rest of the application.  This session explores the basics of Test-Driven Development:  unit tests; setting up test data; and automating your tests.

## Title: Parallel Data Warehouse - Architecture Overview
## Abstract:
### In Nov.2010, Microsoft officially released SQL Server 2008 R2 PDW Edition. Parallel Data Warehouse is a true MPP (massive parallel processing) platform featuring an ultra shared nothing architecture. PDW is capable of delivering very fast query performance and can house up to 500 TB of data. This session will overview both the HW and SW architecture of the PDW appliance. It will explain how Microsoft and HP have engineered a solution using commodity HW and SW that can compete with more expensive platforms like TeraData and ExaData. Additionally, SQL DBAs will see where their current skillset is applicable to managing a PDW appliance.

## Speaker: David McCarter
## Title: Building nTier Applications with Entity Framework
## Abstract:
### Learn how to build real world nTier applications with the Entity Framework and related services. With this new technology built into .NET, you can easily wrap an object model around your database and have all the data access automatically generated or use your own stored procedures and views. Then learn how to easily and securely expose your object model using WCF with just a few line of code using ADO.NET Data Services. The session will demonstrate how to create and consume these new technologies from the ground up.
