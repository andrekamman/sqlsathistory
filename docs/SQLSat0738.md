Event Date: 26-04-2018 - Session time: 16:35:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Lior King
## Title: SPECIAL KEYNOTE: The DBA is DEAD!   Long live the NEW DBA !
## Abstract:
### The DBA's role is slowly changing and some of the old-school DBA work gradually becomes irrelevant. New technologies such as the cloud, big data, devops and automation are making many of the classic DBA tasks simply unnecessary.
Are DBAs no longer needed? (spoiler: they still are).
What should you do to stay relevant amidst the technology changes in the industry?
We will talk about the new industry trends that are changing the DBA's role, about new career paths that the "new DBA" can take and what new skills DBAs should acquire for each of these paths.

# Speak your hands – using body language for effective presentations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#738---Israel-2018)
Event Date: 26-04-2018 - Session time: 16:35:00 - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker: Alexander Arvidsson
## Title: Speak your hands – using body language for effective presentations
## Abstract:
### Your body language can be a great asset to your presentation skills, and it can also be a good reason your presentation is relegated to the bottom of the scrap heap. Why is it that some speakers make you feel warm and fuzzy, like you instantly like them, while other speakers make you want to leave? Science tells us time and again that the nonverbal part of communication is a very important and significant, but still surprisingly few speakers – especially technical speakers – give it much thought.

 In this hour I go through several pointers for using your hands to convey and reinforce your message. I give ample examples of both good and bad body language and show you several tips and tricks to seriously enhance your stage presence.  Attend this session to learn about how body language can make sure you convey what you think you do!

# Azure and SQL Server: Getting the best out of the cloud
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#738---Israel-2018)
Event Date: 26-04-2018 - Session time: 16:35:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Murilo Miranda
## Title: Azure and SQL Server: Getting the best out of the cloud
## Abstract:
### SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds, reducing operational costs.
 
For example, by taking advantage of services like Azure Blob Storage or Azure VMs
we can increase the availability of our services or distribute data in smart
ways that benefit our performance and decrease cost.

In this session, you will learn the strongest use cases for hybrid scenarios
between on-premises and the cloud, and open a new horizon of what you can do
with your SQL Server infrastructure.

## Title: The Future of the DBA Panel with Lior King  Asaf Aviv
## Abstract:
### In the era of cloud, automation, big data and some other hot buzzwords – what does the future role of the DBA look like? Are we even going to need DBAs in the future? And if we do – are we still going to run maintenance plans? Set up disaster recovery solutions? Implement security best practices? And when is that future anyway? One year from now? Five years? More?
Lior King is going to present the keynote in SQL Saturday Israel 2018, and the topic is “The Future of the DBA”. We are going to grab him right after the keynote, and develop a fascinating discussion with him and with the audience. If you are a DBA today, and you are not sure what you are going to be tomorrow, then this session is for you…

SQL Server is using all of the memory available for it on the server, but is it enough? 
What could be wrong if SQL Server will have too much memory?
Why Doesn’t SQL Server Release Memory?
How to identify when the system was under external and/or internal memory pressure?
What are the RING_BUFFER_RESOURCE_MONITOR telling me?
Who is filling my memory?
How much server memory is being wasted by storing empty space?
Large-page memory (trace flag 834) could it help Columnstore indexes?
How much memory can a single session have?

## Speaker: Matan Yungman
## Title: Database Continuous Integration Panel with Amir Fourey  Hila Bar
## Abstract:
### Continuous integration is a development and deployment methodology that has been around for many years. Many dev teams use this methodology to constantly build and deploy application releases. But for some reason, the database world has been left behind. Even today, there is still not a single methodology or tool that really works. Each organization creates its own tools and methodologies to manage the integration and deployment of database changes. Why is it so hard?

## Speaker: Anat Dror
## Title: The freedom to choose. Selecting the correct SQL Server flavor for you
## Abstract:
### In the past, choosing the right SQL Server meant that you basically only needed to choose the correct edition. Then came the question whether you going to have it virtualized or not.
Nowadays, while virtualized or not is almost always answered “virtualized”, there are much more questions to answer before you can finalize your decision: where will the database be hosted, will it be on-premise or in the cloud, on windows or on Linux, do I want to create the database engine myself or use a managed database and many more. Join this session to get an overall view of all options available including Azure DB, APS, RDS, Azure IASS, Azure managed instances, hybrid solutions and more. We will talk about the considerations for choosing any of the options and discuss the relative benefits of each.

# Database Modeling In Practice
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#738---Israel-2018)
Event Date: 26-04-2018 - Session time: 16:35:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Andrey Zavadskiy
## Title: Database Modeling In Practice
## Abstract:
### Many times we had created databases according to KISS principle – small set of objects, 3rd NF. Then they were getting more complex, and less efficient. We had to add more features to application, reporting, logging, history lookups. Someday the database became a mess. Oh! If I had known all the demands the day I'd made the first table, I'd have offered a better solution...
In this session, we look at some issues that arise in database modeling. We'll try to look at a database from different angles – model, implementation, performance, application that works with that database and business value. We'll touch a logical and physical design, and such things like an "entity vs attribute" problem, denormalization, table splitting, strategy of primary key implementation, how to provide history of data changes, archiving, etc. 
This session would give you some thoughts and ideas about what to consider when you create a database.

## Speaker: Matan Yungman
## Title: Big Data in SQL Server Panel with Ronen Chenn  Elad Shwarchberg
## Abstract:
### Big Data is everywhere these days. There are a lot of Big Data scenarios, from IoT (Internet of Things) to AI (Artificial Intelligence). The common challenge to all of these scenarios is to handle very large volume, velocity and variety of data (a.k.a “the 3 V’s”). There are plenty of data platforms to handle Big Data scenarios. Some of them are NoSQL databases, while others are relational. Some of them are open-source, while others are not. Some are MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) platforms, while others are SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) platforms. In many cases, SQL Server is not the right choice, and you should learn about other data platforms and choose the best one to handle your workload.
On the other hand, SQL Server offers a lot of features and capabilities to handle Big Data scenarios, and in many cases, it can be the best solution.

## Speaker: Maria Zakourdaev
## Title: The extraordinary effect of Python support in SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Python is one of the most popular languages this days and we are very excited to have an ability to use Python inside SQL Server stored procedures starting SQL Server 2017.
If you are Database Administrator - you need to get to know this wonderful feature! Learn how it can solve DBA's everyday challenges when dealing with text and json files, bulk loads and even simplify ETL flows when you need to get data from database systems other than SQL Server. Moreover, you can offload the big data querying to nosql database and use Python to get the results into SQL server. Have you ever dreamed about receiving emails from SQL Server stored procedure? Yes, Python can do that!
This session will answer questions like:

-	Why do I need to learn Python if I am not working with Machine learning?
-	What are the main components that enable external script execution?
-	How are the external scripts isolated?
-	What is the new Launchpad service?
-	What is the bxlserver.exe and Sql Sattelite API ?

## Speaker: Ronen Ariely
## Title: Azure Elastic Databases  Azure Elastic Jobs
## Abstract:
### A single Azure SQL Database gets dedicated resources (DTUs), which determine CPU, Memory, and the read-write rates that are available to use. The cost of each database is predefined according to the service tier and resources we choose, regardless the actual use.
Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool enables to manage and scale multiple Azure SQL Databases as a group. Databases in a pool share resources (eDTUs). It's a powerful and a cost-effective option for databases that have varying and unpredictable usage demands.
During the meetup, we will review “Azure Elastic Pools” and “Azure Elastic Database jobs”, which enable us to execute queries across a group of databases, aggregate data from multiple databases, and improve performance. We will demonstrate the use and discuss cases, which can be optimized by using these features, including a real-life case where we reduce the cost dramatically.
Join the meeting and learn how to improve performance and reduce the cost of your Azure databases
