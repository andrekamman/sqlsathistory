## Abstract:
### Welcome to Azure DevOps Duet, a tale about how a development team and an operations team have to bond together and start using Azure DevOps for SQL Server related deployments.

We will discuss

After this session you will have the tools and knowledge to get started with DevOps and get your development process to the next level.

If you want to see a session about using Azure DevOps with SQL Server, co-presented by a Microsoft MVP and somebody who is Microsoft certified for both, this is the session for you.
