## Speaker: Ray Kim
## Title: Networking 101: Building professional relationships
## Abstract:
### Networking. You keep hearing that word throughout your career development, but you don’t know much about it, much less, how to do it. You want to connect with technical and data professionals, so you attend events such as SQL Saturday and your local user group. But what about your book club, your gym, your church group, or your kid’s soccer game? Those are prime — and overlooked — opportunities to network!

In this interactive session, we will discuss networking — what it is, why it’s important, and where opportunities exist. You will even have an opportunity to practice networking within the confines of our room. You might even leave this session with new networking contacts that you didn’t previously have!

# SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#912---New-York-City-2019)
Event Date: 05-10-2019 - Session time: 16:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Paul Stanton
## Title: SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases
## Abstract:
### DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.

# Version control with GIT for the DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#912---New-York-City-2019)

## Speaker: Justin Dearing
## Title: Version control with GIT for the DBA
## Abstract:
### In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. Microsoft has fully embraced Git. It powers modern on premise and cloud versions of TFS (now know as Azure Devops) as well GitHub, which Microsoft recently acquired. 

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

Why should I store my schema in SSDT to help prevent developers from using code first ORMs.
What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.

## Speaker: Kevin Feasel
## Title: Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments
## Abstract:
### Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.

## Title: High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS
## Abstract:
### The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

Cloud  Datacenter MVP David Bermingham takes explains all this and more in the session.

## Speaker: Ashwini Jain
## Title: How to automate row level security in Power BI using DAX and SSAS
## Abstract:
### Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in your app or website. This session is for users are who want to automate Power BI row-level security by replicating the security of another data source such as corporate ERP. Many organizations maintain tight data security within their organization. Row-level security needs to be defined within Power BI. This can be difficult if you have many users and security changes happen quite often. If you are using a corporate ERP system that has security built into it, you would end up doing redundant work of managing security at two places, in ERP as well as in Power BI. DAX query can be used to filter out rows based on user ID/user name. We will go over the demo of the entire process starting from bringing data into SSAS, creating data model, applying row level security  publish the report. Never again you will have to manually manage roles within Power BI.

## Title: Database DevOps with Visual Studio and Jenkins
## Abstract:
### Are your database releases time-consuming, complicated, and exception-driven?  Do you wish you could deploy just a few of the changes from database 1 to database 2?  Does your boss say “we should do more of this DevOps stuff”?  Time to think about automation.

Keeping your “desired state” database in version control is the first step toward easy, repeatable deployments.  When your database contains exactly what it’s supposed to, there’s no such thing as “but it worked in Dev.”  And that’s just the beginning.

Join Larry Blake and Shantan Kallu from Teach for America to learn how they created custom Jenkins pipelines to automate deployments, run unit tests, introduce code review approval steps, manage logins, and more.  No Jenkins knowledge is assumed.
