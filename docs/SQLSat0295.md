# Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#295---Las-Vegas-2014)
Event Date: 05-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 2
## Speaker: David Klee
## Title: Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server
## Abstract:
### Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.

#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#295---Las-Vegas-2014)
Event Date: 05-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 1
## Speaker: Ed Watson
## Title: "So you have a performance issue.  What now?"
## Abstract:
### You're a new DBA, want to be a DBA or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings.  Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  Their query or stored procedure took a very long time to run.  Can you help them?  Do you even know where to begin to help them?  Most sessions I've attended on performance tuning seem to start in the middle.  They take the approach that the audience has some understanding on how or where to start.  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow".

Event Date: 05-04-2014 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: DBA 2
## Speaker: Randy Knight
## Title: But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs
## Abstract:
### If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

## Speaker: Reeves Smith
## Title: Increase your SSIS productivity with Biml
## Abstract:
### Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML language for Microsoft Business Intelligence that can take your Integration Services package development to the next level. Creating template packages added productivity to your Integration Services development effort. If the template design changes after development begins, a fair amount of rework to packages could be needed. See how Biml can help create template packages that can better adapt to changing business needs and allow for more comprehensive design or redesign. 

This session will be a demo based session that will inspire you to make Biml your number one integration services development tool. Learn how to use Biml scripts to create staging tables and integration services packages. Add metadata to your Biml scripts and really watch the possibilities expand.
