# Getting the Skinny on Minimally Logged Operations
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#452-Charlotte-2015)
Event Date: 17-10-2015 - Session time: 15:00:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Andrew Kelly
## Title: Getting the Skinny on Minimally Logged Operations
## Abstract:
### Any changes to Non-Memory Optimized tables require a certain amount of logging to the transaction log in order to ensure the integrity of the operation and of course the database. Most of these are fully logged operations and can write a tremendous amount of data to the transaction log. As you probably already know these can lead to various performance and availability issues. However you may be able to minimize the effect of these with what is called a minimally logged operation. This session will outline how these can be used under the right conditions to save time, resources and potentially a lot of headaches. Various demos will hit home on just how much of an impact this can have on some every day operations.

## Speaker: George Walkey
## Title: Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery
## Abstract:
### Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers

We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel
## Abstract:
### Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ PowerPivot for Excel to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.
