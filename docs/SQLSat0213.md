## Title: Reporting Services for Mere DBAs
## Abstract:
### As a DBA in the modern era, you may be required from time to time to do something outside of your comfort zone.  One of these things may be to become quickly acquainted with SSRS.  Even better is that you may be required to do things you have not considered in a standard report.  In this session, you will learn how to implement a framework to help provide a common ground for your reports.  This session will delve into fun topics such as dynamic grouping and dynamic sorting.  We are not talking about the interactive sorting that your accountant may use.  Attendees will also be introduced to a few quick methods of exporting Reports from the report server - this is from a DBA perspective after-all!

## Title: SQL 2012 Table Compression
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

## Speaker: Dan Clark
## Title: Building Your First Tabular Model
## Abstract:
### With the release of SSAS 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new BI storage engine. In addition to the traditional OLAP engine you now have the option to build your BI models on top of the new Vertipaq engine. To use the new Vertipaq engine you build a Tabular data model.  A new query language DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to query the data, create calculations, measures, and KPI’s.This session is designed to introduce you to the process of building a tabular model in SQL Server Data Tools (BIDS rebranded). We will import data from a SQL Server relational database into a tabular model project and create relationships between the tables. We will use DAX to create and manage calculations, measures, and Key Performance Indicators

## Speaker: Dan Clark
## Title: Mastering Date-Time Based Analysis in DAX
## Abstract:
### A large volume of analysis that a business typically performs on its data involves dates and/or times. For example, you may need to compare sales from one year to the next or aggregate transactions over time.  DAX incorporates many built in time intelligence functions to help make date-time based calculations easier. Although the time intelligence functions are very beneficial, they can be misused and give erroneous results.This session is guides you through the various time intelligence functions available in DAX and provide practical examples of how to use them.

## Speaker: John Miner
## Title: Full Text Indexing Basics
## Abstract:
### Abstract:

Today’s large data fields (LDF) are full of unstructured information stored in varchar, text, varbinary or xml data types. How do you write an 
application to search the column for patterns? Traditional SQL techniques using a column INDEX and LIKE operator result in a query plan that contains a full table scan.

I will be introducing the brother’s grimm database that has the full text of each fairy tale. I will create a full text catalog / index, select a change tracking strategy, 
define optional stop list / thesaurus file, and then populate the index. I will use CONTAINS and FREETEXT operators in SELECT queries to leverage the FTI. This resulting query plan performs index seek.

Coverage:

1 – Creating a database from scratch.
2 – Creating a table with LOB field.
3 – Loading files via BULK INSERT.
4 – Performance via traditional techniques.
5 – Creating a full text index.
6 – Performance with the full text index.

## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: What the VLF? 
## Abstract:
### Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.

## Speaker: Mike Hillwig
## Title: DBA's Rules for Dummies... And Developers
## Abstract:
### In many organizations, there is a rift between DBAs and developers. The root cause is that there isn't often an established framework between what the DBAs need to manage the data and what developers need to help solve business problems. Many DBAs think that developers just write code without considering the impact to the data. And many developers think that DBA means 'Dont' Bother Asking." 

In this session for developers, veteran production DBA Mike Hillwig will help you understand the DBA's needs in order to help you bridge that gap in your organization and work better to help solve business problems.
