# Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#60---Cleveland-2011)
Event Date: 05-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 325
## Speaker: Eddie Wuerch
## Title: Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers
## Abstract:
### An often-overlooked aspect to data optimization is what is happens under the covers – how does SQL Server store and access data?  There are plenty of common rules covering tuning, but this session looks at data access from the physical layer, detailing how table access and indexes work, showing why some designs perform poorly, and why adding more indexes may not help.  This will not be a discussion of normal forms or design rules. Instead, it will be a technical session providing the foundation for you to choose which concepts to apply to your designs.
  The session starts with the notion that SQL Server is not a magic box – most of what happens is well-documented and must be taken into consideration when designing or tuning databases.

# Gathering and Interpreting Performance Metrics
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#60---Cleveland-2011)
Event Date: 05-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 330
## Speaker: Grant Fritchey
## Title: Gathering and Interpreting Performance Metrics
## Abstract:
### To begin tuning your system and the queries that run on it, you must begin from a position of knowledge. The knowledge I’m talking about is knowing what is occurring on your systems. What kind of load is the server under? How many times is that stored procedure called? This session will present the basics of gathering and interpreting knowledge about your server and the queries running on it. We’ll cover a variety of topics from performance monitor, to server-side traces, to dynamic management objects. We’ll go over how to set these things up to monitor your system and how to interpret the data returned from them. This session is part of a full day of training which will be presented in May at SQL Rally in Florida.

# (SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Match)
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#60---Cleveland-2011)
Event Date: 05-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 315
## Speaker: Ira Warren
## Title: (SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Match)
## Abstract:
### We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS). Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms.The steps are as follows: 1. Cleansing and standardization 2. Group records 3. Split records 4. Compare records and determine scores 5. Split into separate match categories 6. Analyze results of matches 7. Evaluate using match tools to determine if best algorithms have been combined.

# The "Tally" Table  High Speed "Pseudo Cursors"
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#60---Cleveland-2011)
Event Date: 05-02-2011 - Session time: 00:00:00 - Track: Room 314
## Speaker: Jeff Moden
## Title: The "Tally" Table  High Speed "Pseudo Cursors"
## Abstract:
### There are dozens of things we do in T-SQL which require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters", "loops" and recursion to most people. To those well versed in the “Black Arts” of high performance "Set-based" programming, it means a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. This “Developer-to-Developer” session starts with the basics of how SQL Server can be tricked into counting faster than you can imagine, how that simple act of counting replaces slothful loops and other forms of “RBAR”, and provides a substantial introduction to “set based thinking. The session also includes tips on using Pseudo Cursors, CROSS APPLY, and INLINE TABLE VALUED FUNCTIONS (iTVFs) to make your code that much faster .

## Speaker: Jeff Mlakar
## Title: Using SQL Azure in an SSMS Addin
## Abstract:
### The Cloud is fast becoming the latest hot topic in the technology arena.  We need to understand how we as SQL Developers and Administrators can utilize SQL Azure, Microsoft’s platform for relational data storage in the Cloud, to meet our needs.  It doesn’t always have to be full sites deployed to the Cloud, it could also be "hybrid solutions", with a Client tool accessing a Cloud database. That is what will be demonstrated in this talk:  A step-by-step demo of how to obtain an Azure subscription, create and administer a SQL Azure database, and work with it from your own SQL Server Management Studio Addin.  The end result is an Addin in SSMS that uses the SQL Azure Cloud as a common script repository.

## Speaker: Rob Collie
## Title: PowerPivot:  BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans
## Abstract:
### The paradox of Business Intelligence:  it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor.  Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us.  Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow?

In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications).  The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :)

I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)

## Speaker: Sam Nasr
## Title: Programming with FileStreams
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2008 introduced the FileStream object.  This allowed developers to resolve an age long dilemma of storing large binary files in the database or accessing them on the file system.  SS08 provides the best of both worlds while allowing applications to access the data readily through the FileStream object via Transact SQL or File I/O.

## Speaker: Sandra Mueller
## Title: Developing Date and Role-Playing Dimensions 
## Abstract:
### Every data warehouse needs a date dimension to help users slice and dice data. What should be included in the dimension, what is enough and what is too much? Should you use the wizard to generate the dimension for you; what are the advantages and disadvantages? We will explore a generic date dimension load script, loading a custom table and configuring SSAS to use the table as the time dimension. Finally we will address the advantages of role-playing dimensions to make an Order Date, Ship Date, Received Date exposed to users as opposed to multiple date dimensions.

## Speaker: William E Pearson III
## Title: Getting Started with MDX
## Abstract:
### In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.
