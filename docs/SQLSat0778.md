## Speaker: Kevin Boles
## Title: Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!
## Abstract:
### ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from the same flaws.

# Database Design Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#778---Memphis-2018)
Event Date: 06-10-2018 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Application  Database Development
## Speaker: Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Abstract:
### Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.

## Speaker: Brian Hansen
## Title: Let's Explore SQL Internals
## Abstract:
### Have you ever wondered how SQL Server stores your data?  With so many ways that it can be done, we couldn't possibly cover everything in this session, but we'll discuss the fundamental building blocks that SQL uses to organize data into usable units.  We'll also see how we can peek under the covers to actually view some of the strutures involved.  Why?  Because understanding how the pieces fit together will help you to design better, more efficient databases and tables, as well as providing knowledge of a critical component of how the SQL optimizer comes up with query plans.

## Speaker: Chris Hyde
## Title: Python in SQL Server 2017
## Abstract:
### SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!

# The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#778---Memphis-2018)
Event Date: 06-10-2018 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Enterprise Database Administration  Deployment
## Speaker: Amy Herold
## Title: The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code
## Abstract:
### There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance. 

How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.

# Hello My Friends, Welcome to CosmosDB
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#778---Memphis-2018)
Event Date: 06-10-2018 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Peter Shore
## Title: Hello My Friends, Welcome to CosmosDB
## Abstract:
### Microsoft says Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database.  Your reaction might be something like, “what the heck is it”, “why would I use it”, or “how do I use it”.  The fundamental purpose of this session is to answer those very questions.  After briefly discussing what CosmosDB is, we’ll take some time to discuss why you might use CosmosDB instead of SQL Server or another platform, and finally touch on some basics to get you started with CosmosDB.  Upon completion of this session you will be better equipped to discuss the value of CosmosDB to your organization.

# Using Your On-prem Data in a Cloud World
#### [Back to calendar](#SQLSaturday-#778---Memphis-2018)
Event Date: 06-10-2018 - Session time: 14:45:00 - Track: Cloud Application Development  Deployment
## Speaker: Daniel Glenn
## Title: Using Your On-prem Data in a Cloud World
## Abstract:
### Microsoft Power BI, Flow, and PowerApps are powerful cloud tools that can take your on-premises data to new heights. Using your data where it is now gives you the ability to invest in improving processes, instead of focusing on a data migration strategy.

In this session, we will discover the benefits of using the cloud tools, how those benefits translate to being on-prem, and how we can use the data in Office 365 as well. We will setup a data gateway, connect to on-prem data sources, and use that data in Office 365 and SharePoint Server 2016.
