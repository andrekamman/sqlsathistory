## Title: Data Analytics and the DBA – Using PowerView to Uncover Interesting Facts About Your SQL Servers
## Abstract:
### DBAs do not always have time to work with some of the amazing visual data tools that are becoming common place now for analysts. In this presentation I will show how in just a few very easy steps you can learn more than the basics of PowerView, PowerPivot and Data Mining using data you are already familiar with as a DBA, your SQL Server installation data. We will analyze growth patterns in databases, witness job failures interactively across hundreds of servers, discover elevated permissions in a flash and watch a movie of your infrastructure growing and changing before your eyes.
