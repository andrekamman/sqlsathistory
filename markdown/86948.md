## Title: How Cloud Computing Empowers a Data Scientist
## Abstract:
### The last few years, we have seen an explosion in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The rise of cloud computing has been a major factor in this explosion. Cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Azure, enable users to quickly spin up clusters of computers to perform the high-performance calculations required by data science problems. 
Azure offers a number of tools for building data science solutions: From a drag and drop interface to Jupyter Notebooks as a service to a Virtual Machine pre-configured with powerful Machine Learning tools.
In this session, you will learn how the cloud has impacted data science, the most useful tools in Azure for a data scientist, and when it is appropriate to use each tool.
